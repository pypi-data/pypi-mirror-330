Python SVG Chart Generator (pysvgchart)
=======================================

A Python package for creating and rendering SVG charts, including line
charts, axes, legends, and text labels. This package supports both
simple and complex chart structures and is highly customizable for
various types of visualizations.

Why did I make this project
---------------------------
Many charting libraries rely on JavaScript-driven client-side rendering, often requiring an intermediate canvas before
producing a polished visual. This package takes a different approach: it generates clean, standalone SVG charts
entirely within Python. By leveraging SVG’s inherent scalability and styling flexibility, it eliminates the need for
JavaScript dependencies, client-side rendering, or post-processing steps. The result is a lightweight, backend-friendly
solution for producing high-quality, resolution-independent charts without sacrificing control or maintainability.

While many popular Python charting libraries focus on image-based rendering, and those that support SVG output often
produce cumbersome, hard-to-customize files, this library is built with customization at its core. Every chart
element is designed to be easily modified, giving developers precise control over appearance and structure.

Features
--------

-  **Modular Structure**: Create SVG charts with reusable components
   like ``Line``, ``Text``, ``Axis``, and ``Shape``.
-  **Axis Scaling**: Automatically generates axis tick values based on
   the data range with customizable limits.
-  **Customizable Styles**: Supports custom styles for lines, text, and
   axes.
-  **Legends**: Add legends to your charts to represent different data
   series.
-  **Dynamic Rendering**: Render a chart in SVG format with full control
   over size, style, and elements.
-  **Support for Simple and Advanced Charts**: Create simple line charts
   or extend the functionality for more complex visualizations.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install pysvgchart

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install it locally:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/arowley-ai/py-svg-chart.git
   cd py-svg-chart
   pip install .

Usage
-----

Create a simple line chart with the following code:

.. code:: python

   import pysvgchart as psc

   # Sample data
   x_values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   y_values = [[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]

   # Create the chart
   chart = psc.SimpleLineChart(x_values, y_values, y_names=["Series 1", "Series 2"])

   # Add a legend
   chart.add_legend(x_position=500, y_position=60, element_x=100, element_y=0, line_length=20, line_text_gap=5)

   chart.series[0].styles['stroke'] = 'red'
   chart.series[1].styles['stroke'] = 'blue'
   chart.x_axis.axis_line.styles['stroke'] = 'black'

   # Render the chart as an SVG string
   svg_output = chart.render

   # Save the SVG output to a file
   with open("chart.svg", "w") as f:
       f.write(svg_output)


Extensible Configuration
------------------------

The entire codebase is designed to be extensible to enable unlimited
customisation. All of the lower level elements are accessible via
properties of the charts.
