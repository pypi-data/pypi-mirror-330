# My game

I don't do video games.
Instead I have my own logic game.
The goal is to express solutions to business problems in the briefest way
possible, in Python.

I'm every bit as devoted to my game as a gamer.
What you get from such code is...
- flexible code that responds well to changing requirements
- answers to business questions in days and weeks instead of weeks and months.
- correct answers
- answers to unexpected questions
- a solid base for further work.
- debuggable because it's compact.
- copy-pastable if that's what you want.


## What I need to to excel at the game.

- to know everything about the Python language with special attention to the
  basics.
- to thoroughly understand the business question.
- Translate the business question into Python code.


## Visible work so far

- API client generator     ready for primetime
- Postman alternative      wip


### Note

business quesion.  Not business problem.
