    What I want, is an API explorer for CLI. A tool that takes an OpenAPI Spec
    and then converts it into a set of examples and REST endpoint calls I can
    just fire off or mess with. Kinda like how Swagger does for their web-based
    docs, but for CLI, and bonus points if you can generate some examples.

    I feel like this should be possible with today's tech, but am coming up dry
    finding anything while searching.
 

Complaints about Bruno

    Last time I looked, Bruno lacked some critical features:
    Shared workspace among team mates.
    Collections.
    Workflows (perform API calls in sequence).
    Ability to generate random data.
    Ability to consume streams of data.
    Ability to interact with non-REST and non-HTTP endpoints (websockets, gRPC, tRPC, GraphQL).


Kudos to Bruno

    pre/post scripts with variable/env reading/writing
    simple notation that can be pushed to git along the rest of the code
    no f* cloud!
    fast and beautiful
    app + CLI + vscode extension
    absolutely ZERO bloat.
