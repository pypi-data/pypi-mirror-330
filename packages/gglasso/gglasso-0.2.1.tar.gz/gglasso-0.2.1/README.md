This package contains algorithms for solving General Graphical Lasso (GGLasso) problems, including single, multiple, as well as latent 
Graphical Lasso problems. <br>

## Getting started

### Install via pip/conda

The package is available on pip and conda and can be installed with

    pip install gglasso

or

    conda install -c conda-forge gglasso


### Developer installation

If you want to create a conda environment with full development dependencies (for building docs, testing,...), run:

	conda env create -f environment.yml

To install `gglasso` in developer mode run

    python -m pip install --editable .


Test your installation with 

    pytest tests/ -v




## The `glasso_problem` class

`GGLasso` can solve multiple problem forumulations, e.g. single and multiple Graphical Lasso problems as well as with and without latent factors. Therefore, the main entry point for the user is the `glasso_problem` class which chooses automatically the correct solver and model selection functionality. See [our documentation](https://gglasso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/problem-object.html) for all the details.


## Algorithms

`GGLasso` contains algorithms for solving a multitude of Graphical Lasso problem formulations. For all the details, we refer to the [solver overview in our documentation](https://gglasso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solvers-overview.html).

The package includes solvers for the following problems:<br>

- **Single Graphical Lasso**<br>

- **Group and Fused Graphical Lasso**<br>
We implemented the ADMM (see [2] and [3]) and a proximal point algorithm (see [4]). 

- **Non-conforming Group Graphical Lasso**<br>
A Group Graphical Lasso problem where not all variables exist in all instances/datasets.  

- **Functional Graphical Lasso**<br>
A variant of Graphical Lasso where each variables has a functional representation (e.g. by Fourier coefficients).

Moreover, for all problem formulation the package allows to model latent variables (Latent variable Graphical Lasso) in order to estimate a precision matrix of type *sparse - low rank*.
