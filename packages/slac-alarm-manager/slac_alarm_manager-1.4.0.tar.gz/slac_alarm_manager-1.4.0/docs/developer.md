# Developer Information

This section includes some additional information that will be useful to anyone who wishes to build
their own interface to NALMS in a similar fashion to either the alarm manager or the PyDM data plugin. Or anyone
just looking for a few extra technical details.

This documentation is still under development, will be updated soon.
