# LLMRepo

Lets say I have this codebase that I built a few months ago, and I completely forgot what it was about. I want to send it over to Claude, or ChatGPT, or Deepseek, but it's a tedious task to copy and paste every file in there, and even if I did, the LLM has no idea what my file structure is like. This is what this tool aims to address.

LLMRepo is a command-line tool designed to help users easily convert a directory into a LLM-friendly format.

This program recursively searches through a specified directory and outputs, _directly to the clipboard_, a directory structure, as well as the content of any non-directory files.

### Installation

```
pip install llmrepo
```

### Usage

```
llmrepo /path/to/directory
```

This outputs the following directly to the clipboard, as well as in the terminal:

```
# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

my-project/
|-- database/
|   |-- sqlite-connect.py
|  `-- models.py
`-- main.py

## sqlite-connect.py
// Contents of sqlite-connect.py

## models.py
// Contents of models.py

## main.py
// Contents of sqlite-connect.py
```

Any additional flags and commands can be viewed through the `-h` or `--help` flag.

```
llmrepo -h
```
