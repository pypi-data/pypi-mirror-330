This is a better version of random module, which is called randomv2, it contains all the functions from the random module and it also contains few new once, 
They are rand_inf(), rand_prob(), rand_prob_times(), the rand_inf() gives output any number between -infinity and +infinity, it can give output of any float or int between it. The rand_prob() gives out the output of any element in a gives list, that will be its first argument, and the second will contain a list with the probabilties of the elements, and the last parameter contain the number of times you want it to pick. The next and the last(for now) is the rand_prob_times() works same as rand_prob(), but the output will not be in a list but single values for multiple times
This is still a test module and is working fine, anyone can use it, and please give certain feedback or any place where their can be improvment
