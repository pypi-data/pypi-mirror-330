# pluma-analysis

![build](https://github.com/emotional-cities/pluma-analysis/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

A low-level interface to data collected with the [pluma](https://github.com/emotional-cities/pluma) urban data acquisition system. Data used in the notebooks has been made publicly available in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets.

More information about sample data sharing can be found in the [eMOTIONAL Cities data-share repository](https://github.com/emotional-cities/data-share).

## Set-up Instructions

We recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for python version, environment, and package dependency management. However, any other tool compatible with the `pyproject.toml` standard should work.

### Install from PyPI

```
uv pip install pluma-analysis
```

### Install from source

```
git clone https://github.com/emotional-cities/pluma-analysis.git
cd pluma-analysis
uv sync --all-extras
```
