# TkinterHotReload

A powerful hot reload utility for Tkinter applications that enables real-time code updates without restarting your application.

## Features

- üîÑ Live code reloading for Tkinter applications
- üöÄ Zero configuration required
- üéØ Automatic detection of file changes
- üíª Seamless development experience
- üõ† Maintains application state during reloads

## Installation

Install TkinterHotReload using pip:

```bash
pip install tkhr --upgrade
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use TkinterHotReload:

```python
import tkhotreload as tkhr
from tkinter import Label, Button


def main(root: tkhr.TkinterHotReload):
    # Use the new properties method to set multiple attributes at once
    root.properties(
        title="Tk Inter Reload",
        always_on_top=True,
        alpha=0.5,
        icon="icon.ico",
        debug=False,
    )
    Label(root, text="Change this and save!").pack(pady=20)
    Button(root, text="Click me", command=lambda: print("Clicked!")).pack()


tkhr.app(target=main, watch_dir=".", exclude=["*.pyc", "__pycache__"])
```

## How It Works

TkinterHotReload monitors your Python files for changes. When you modify and save a file, it automatically:

1. Detects the changes in your code
2. Reloads the modified modules
3. Updates your Tkinter application while preserving its state
