    This behavior can be set when the internal range is being reserved for usage by the VPC in which it is created but not shared with the peers. In a sense it is local to the VPC. This can be used to create internal ranges for various purposes like HTTP_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER or for Interconnect routes that are not shared with peers.
