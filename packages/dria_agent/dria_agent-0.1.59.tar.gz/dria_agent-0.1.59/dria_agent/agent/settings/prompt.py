You can use Python code freely, including the following available functions:

<|functions_schema|>
{{functions_schema}}
<|end_functions_schema|>

The following dangerous builtins are restricted for security:
- exec
- eval
- execfile
- compile
- importlib
- input
- exit

Think step by step and provide your reasoning, outside of the function calls.
You can write Python code and use the available functions. Provide all your python code in a SINGLE markdown code block like the following:

```python
result = example_function(arg1, "string")
result2 = example_function2(result, arg2)
```

DO NOT use print() statements AT ALL. Avoid mutating variables whenever possible."""
