    Voxel-based downsampling of a batch of point clouds.

    Args:
        coords: Coordinates of the points to be downsampled.
        batch_indices: Indices indicating to which input point cloud each point in the batch belongs.
        point_cloud_sizes: Number of points contained in each input point cloud.
        voxel_size: The size of the voxels used for downsampling.
        features: The features of the points to be downsampled. Defaults to `None`.
        feature_aggregation: Method to be used to aggregate features of points within the same voxel: `"max"` | \
            `"mean"` | `"min"` | `"nearest_neighbor"`. `"nearest_neighbor"` means that the features of the point \
            closest to the voxel center are selected.
        point_aggregation: Method to be used to aggregate the point coordinates within the same voxel: `"mean"` |
            `"nearest_neighbor"`. `"nearest_neighbor"` means that the coordinates of the point closest to the voxel
            center are selected.
        preserve_order: If this is set to `True` and `point_aggregation` is set to `"nearest_neighbor"`, the point order
            is preserved during downsampling. This means that for any two points included in the downsampled point
            cloud, the point that is first in the original point cloud is also first in the downsampled point cloud.
            Defaults to `True`.
        start: Coordinates of a point at which the voxel grid is to be aligned, i.e., the grid is placed so that it
            starts at a corner point of a voxel. Defaults to `None`, which means that the grid is aligned at the
            coordinate origin.

    Returns:
        Tuple of five tensors. The first contains the coordinates of the downsampled points. The second tensor contains
        the features of the downsampled points and is `None` if no input features are provided. The third contains
        indices indicating to which point cloud each downsampled point belongs. The fourth contains the size of each
        downsampled point cloud. The fifth contains indices indicating in which voxel each point from the original point
        clouds is located.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `start` is not `None` and has an invalid shape.
