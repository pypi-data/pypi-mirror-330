# Casino1v1 - The Blackjack Game That Will Destroy Your Ego  

## About  
So, you think you're good at Blackjack? Cute. Welcome to **Casino1v1**, 
where you'll battle the dealer in a game of luck, strategy, and pure frustration.  
Try to hit **21** without going over, but letâ€™s be realâ€”youâ€™ll probably bust and blame bad luck.  

## Installation  
You can install this disasterpiece like any other Python package:  

Why Play This?
1. You like pain.
2. You enjoy being mocked by a Python script.
3. You think you can outsmart a few lines of code (you canâ€™t).
4. You just want to rage-quit after losing to a virtual dealer.
||||||
How to Play
1. You and the dealer get two cards each.
2. You decide to hit (draw another card) or stand (keep what you have).
3. If you go over 21, congratulationsâ€”you lose.
4. The dealer follows mysterious rules that somehow always work against you.
5. Either you win, or the dealer reminds you why casinos make billions.
