*"Pixel Invaders"* is a retro arcade game where you pilot a spaceship to destroy waves of alien invaders. Designed in Python with the Pyxel library, it blends classic pixel art and action for a dynamic yet nostalgic experience.

This project is an introductory exercise in leveraging GitHub's capabilities, including pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions. Additionally, it serves as a learning experience for packaging and publishing on PyPI.

## Prerequisites

This project requires [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the official Python website.

## Features

#### Gameplay  

- Pilot a spaceship to defend the galaxy against relentless enemy waves.  
- Fire classic lasers or smart missiles that home in on the nearest enemy.  
- Overheat mechanism prevents spamming, promoting strategic shooting.  
- Enemies grow stronger with each wave.  
- Face powerful bosses at waves 5, 10, 15… each with unique attacks like explosive blasts or defensive barriers.
- Rack up points and survive for as long as possible. 
- Lose all your lives, and it's game over.
- Track your stats and upgrade them

- Power-ups:
  - Speed Boost – Dash through space with increased velocity.
  - Rapid Fire – Unleash a temporary barrage of shots.
  - Extra Life – Grants an additional life.  
  - Big Shot – Fire stronger, faster projectiles.
  - Slow Down Enemies – Temporarily reduces enemy movement speed.

#### Architecture

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Dedicated classes for each game component.  
- Dynamic Wave Management – Configurable via JSON for easy customization.  
- Optimized Asset Management – Efficient handling of spritesheets.  
- Automated Code Styling – Black for clean Python formatting, enforced via GitHub Actions.
