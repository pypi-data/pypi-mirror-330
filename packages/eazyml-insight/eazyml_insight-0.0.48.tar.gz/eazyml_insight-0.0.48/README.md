A collection of APIs from EazyML family to discover patterns, generate insights, or mine rules from your datasets. Each discovered pattern is expressed as a set of conditions on feature variables - each with a trust-score to reflect confidence in the insight, allowing you to analyze and apply these insights to your data. Ideal for pattern recognition, interpretable AI, and augmented intelligence workflows.

### Features
**Pattern Mining**: Discover meaningful rules from the  datasets.
**Insight Generation**: Generate high-value insights with associated trust scores.
**Application of Rules**: Apply discovered patterns to datasets for further analysis.

Ideal for use cases like interpretability, training data analysis, and building solutions with augmented intelligence.

## Installation
### User installation
The easiest way to install this package for augmented intelligence is using pip:bash
pip install -U eazyml-insight### Dependencies
This package requires:
werkzeug,
unidecode,
pandas,
scikit-learn,
nltk,
pyyaml,
requests

## Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the APIs from this package.
```python
from eazyml_augi import ez_init, ez_augi

# initialize: setup book-keeping, access_key if required 
_ = ez_init()

# discover insights for given dataset using EazyML.
response = ez_augi(mode='classification',
            outcome='target',
            data='train.csv')

# the response object contains insights/patterns that you can explore to integrate in your augmented intelligence workflows.You can find more information in the [documentation](https://eazyml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/eazyml_augi.html).
```
