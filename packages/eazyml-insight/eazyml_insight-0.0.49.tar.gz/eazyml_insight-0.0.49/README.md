A collection of APIs from EazyML family to discover patterns, generate insights, or mine rules from your datasets. Each discovered pattern is expressed as a set of conditions on feature variables - each with a trust-score to reflect confidence in the insight, allowing you to analyze and apply these insights to your data. Ideal for pattern recognition, interpretable AI, and augmented intelligence workflows.

### Features
**Pattern Mining**: Discover meaningful rules from the  datasets.
**Insight Generation**: Generate high-value insights with associated trust scores.
**Application of Rules**: Apply discovered patterns to datasets for further analysis.

Ideal for use cases like interpretability, training data analysis, and building solutions with augmented intelligence.

## Installation
To use the augmented intelligence, ensure you have Python installed on your system.
### User installation
The easiest way to install this package for augmented intelligence is using pip:bash
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-insight
```
### Dependencies
This package requires:
- werkzeug,
- unidecode,
- pandas,
- scikit-learn,
- nltk,
- pyyaml,
- requests

## Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the APIs from this package.
```python
from eazyml_insight import ez_init, ez_insight, ez_validate

# initialize: setup book-keeping, access_key if required 
_ = ez_init()

# discover insights for given dataset using EazyML.
response = ez_insight(
                train_data(`DataFrame/str`) = 'train_dataframe/train_data_path',
                outcome(`str`) = 'target',
                options(`dict`) = {}
        )

# validate insights on given test dataset using EazyML.
response = ez_validate(
                train_data(`DataFrame/str`) = 'train_dataframe/train_data_path',
                outcome(`str`) = 'target',
                insights(`dict`) = 'insights from ez_insight response',
                test_data(`DataFrame/str`) = 'test_dataframe/test_data_path',
                options(`dict`) = {
                    "record_number"(`list of integer`): "Specify the record number of insights in the list from ez_insight for which you want to get the filtered dataset"
            }
        )
# the response object contains insights/patterns that you can explore to integrate in your augmented intelligence workflows.You can find more information in the [documentation](https://eazyml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/eazyml_augi.html).
