Description: # Recommend_py
        
        ## Description
        this is a library to do recommendations based on matrix
        
        ## Functions
        - Function 1: is_utility(df) input the matrix and return if it is a utility matrix
        - Function 2: to_utility(df, id_col_num) input the matrix and the column number of the id and return the utility matrix
        - Function 3: utility_normalize(df) input the utility matrix and return the normalized utility matrix
        - Function 4: utility_standardize(df) input the utility matrix and return the standardized utility matrix
        - Function 5: similarity_calculation(df, mean_same_item) input the utility matrix and the minimum number of same items and return the similarity matrix
        - Function 6: recommend_calculation(df, top_n, mean_score) input the utility matrix, the number of top items to recommend and the minimum score a similar user must give for an item to be recommended and return the recommendation matrix
