Lectures on Elementary Number Theory
      (2nd Edition) by TAKAGI, Teiji
           notebook in Python-NZMATH
             enttakagi version 0.0.4(*1)
====================================
The purpose of this notebook is an easy introduction to Algorithmic
Number Theory --- ANT.  You can study three topics
    'Number Theory'
    'Python Programming'
    'English for Mathematics'(*2)
at a time, which are necessary for ANT, only by running and reading the
programs sec01.py, ..., sec60.py in this directory.  For that, you need
three preparations:
    Get the book by Takagi in the title above.(*3)
    Let Python & package NZMATH usable on your machine.(*4)
    Download all files in this directory to your machine.(*5)
Then, on the command prompt or interactive shell, do
    $ python sec01.py
etc. and read the printed messages.(*6)  The programs themselves in the
files sec01.py, ... are easy English text to read.     That is all!(*7)

    (*1) Based on Python 3.9.16 and NZMATH 3.0.2.
    (*2) 'Japanese for Mathematics' to English readers.

    (*6) When running programs, you are requested to 'Hit Return!'
         so that you can continue after reading the printed messages.
    (*7) Finding and fixing bugs of Python calculator NZMATH on ANT is
         another important purpose for us developers.
