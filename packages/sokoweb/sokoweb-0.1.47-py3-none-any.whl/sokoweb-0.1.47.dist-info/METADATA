# SokoWeb â€“ Decentralized Commerce Network

A decentralized open commerce network for peer-to-peer product/service listings, search, and discovery.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install sokoweb
sokoweb-up
or sokoweb-up -d (detached mode)
```

You'll be prompted for:
* `NODE_PORT` (default: 8000)
* `NODE_TCP_PORT` (default: 8500)
* `ADVERTISE_IP` (default: localhost)

**Note:** Use public IP/domain to join network. Localhost works for exploration but won't connect. Tunneling services like Ngrok typically won't work as network requires UDP and TCP access.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Docker 27.3.1+
* docker compose 2.29.7+

## API Examples

### Register User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "alice",
    "password": "alice123",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "full_name": "Alice Wonderland",
    "phone_number": "+254712345678",
    "scopes": ["products:write", "products:read", "credits:manage"]
  }'
```

### Get Access Token

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=alice&password=alice123&scope=products:write products:read credits:manage"
```

Available scopes:
* `products:write` - Create/modify products
* `products:read` - View products
* `credits:manage` - Purchase/manage credits
* `categories:write` - Suggest categories
* `categories:read` - View categories

### Post Product

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "core": {
      "name": "Smartphone",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "price": 500.00,
      "description": "New smartphone",
      "seller_phone": "+254712345678",
      "shop_name": "Tech Store",
      "seller_location": [-1.2921, 36.8219]
    },
    "extended": {
      "storage_duration_days": 1,
      "tags": ["samsung S21","5G"],
      "metadata": { "color": "black" }
    }
  }'
```

### Upload Product Image

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/products/{product_id}/image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/image.jpg"
```

### Retrieve Products

#### By ID

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/products/{product_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```


#### Search by category/shop

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/products?category=Electronics&shop_name=Tech%20Store" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```


#### Search by location (within radius)

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/products?latitude=-1.2921&longitude=36.8219&radius_km=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```


#### Combined search

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/products?category=Electronics&latitude=-1.2921&longitude=36.8219&radius_km=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```


### Retrieve Product Images

#### 1. Retrieve Single Image

Use this to get the first (or only) associated image of a product:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/products/{product_id}/image" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

* Returns the raw bytes of the image (e.g., "image/png" if PNG)
* You can save/open it directly as an image file if you use a tool like curl with "-o" or Postman's "Save Response"

#### 2. Retrieve All Images (Multi-Image ZIP)

Use this to get all images for a product in a single ZIP file:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/products/{product_id}/images" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  --output images_{product_id}.zip
```

* Responds with a ZIP file (the beginning bytes are "PK", indicating a .zip)
* If you simply view the response as text, you'll see nonsense characters (binary contents). Instead, save it to disk (e.g., --output in curl) and then open with any ZIP program. You'll find all images included in that archive

### Credits Management

#### Check Balance

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/credits/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

#### Purchase Credits

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/credits/purchase \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100,
    "phone_number": "+254712345678"
  }'
```

### Category Operations

```bash
# Suggest a new category (only works in production)
curl -X POST http://<your-public-ip>:8000/categories/suggest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "category_name": "Smart Home"
  }'

# Retrieve all categories
curl http://localhost:8000/categories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

**Note:** Substitute localhost with your Public IP in production. The same applies for port, if it's different in your case.

## Network Management

* View your containers: `docker ps`
* Shut down the network: `sokoweb-down`
