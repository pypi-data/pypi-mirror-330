For C# structs or JSON schemas, copy or reference whatever models you need from
the `models` directory.

To use the Pydantic models directly in Python, install the package with

```bash
pip install vbl-aquarium
```

Then import the models with

```python
from vbl_aquarium.models.module_name import ModelName
```

replacing `.module_name` and `ModelName` with the desired model.
