Release notes
=============

We try to reduce backwards compatibility breakage only to major version releases, i.e. X.0.0. Minor releases (1.X.0) may include new features, whereas patch releases (1.0.X) will generally be used to fix bugs. Not all versions have followed these simple rules to date (and sometimes new features may creep up in patch releases), but we try to adhere them as much as possible :).

Release history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2025.02.27
----------
* Fix error causing vss checks to enter a loop

2024.7.31
---------
New features:

* Detect duplicate lvm volume group names and raise error with volume group information.

4.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------
This release contains some major improvements in the API of imagemounter, making large if-statements obsolete and
obtaining more 'Pythonic' code where possible. It is a continuation of the efforts in version 3.0 and includes fixes
from many contributors.

New features:

* Drop support for Python 2, bump version requirement for Python to 3.6.
* Allowed programmatic access to dependency checks (contributed by gtback). This enables you to write code that checks
  whether certain dependencies are satisfied.
* Changed the way file system types work. Large if-statements in the code have been replaced by class-based
  filesystem types. **Backwards incompatible**
  * The ``fstype`` attribute has been replaced with the ``filesystem`` attribute, but a backwards-compatible
    attribute is still available.
  * The ``_paths`` attribute is no longer available, but replaced by attributes on the :cls:`FileSystem` classes
  * The class-based filesystems implement a form of heuristic to determine the filesystem type.

    .. note::

       This change may result in file systems that were previously correctly detected suddenly not being identified
       correctly. If you encounter such an error, please submit a bug report stating the outputs of the different
       identifiers, the actual result and the expected result. You can obtain this information using ``-vvvv`` on the
       command line.

  * carve and volume shadow copies are now also subvolumes.

* Add support for VBox disk images (vdi) (contributed by ruzzle)
* Add support for VHD volumes (contributed by Jarmo van Lenthe)

Bugfixes:

* Renamed nbd to qemu-nbd (contributed by Jarmo van Lenthe)
* Support for segmented filenames higher than 999 (contributed by jdossett)
* Fixed ``xmount`` command order (contributed by Jarmo van Lenthe)

3.1.0 (2017-08-06)
------------------
New features:

* Support for exFAT filesystems (contributed by ldgriffin)
* Addition of ``force_clean`` method to :class:`ImageParser`
* Addition of :option:`--skip`, to complement :option:`--only-mount`
* Improved support for UFS / BSD volumes

Bugfixes:

* Updated :option:`--keys` to not parse commas (as these may be part of the key themselves) and properly support
  the asterisk key.
* Several fixes for ``fsstat`` call, including actually killing it after 3 seconds and optimizations by passing
  in the correct FS type, making mounting actually a lot faster.
* Fixes for path expanding (contributed by ruzzle)
* Re-index loopbacks prior to unmounting in the :class:`Unmounter` class (contributed by ldgriffin)
* Use ``--sizelimit`` for various mounts, for support in newer kernel versions (contributed by ldgriffin)
* Improved support for non-ASCII volume labels
* The parted detection method does not hang anymore when parted requests input
* Fix for communication of LUKS keys to the ``cryptsetup`` command
* Fixes for reconstruction when multiple roots exist


3.0.1 (2017-04-08)
------------------
* Add support for qcow2 (contributed by Jarmo van Lenthe)
* Allow use of lowercase e01 file extension when mounting a directory in imount CLI (contributed by sourcex)
* Add ADS support for NTFS volumes (contributed by Patrick Leedom)
* Ability to lazily call fusermount -uz when unmounting (contributed by Patrick Leedom)

* Fix regression in mounting LV volumes; the path was incorrectly detected in :func:`get_raw_path` for these volumes.
* Fix regression in detection of single volumes that would be detected as DOS/MBR based on file type.

3.0.0 (2016-12-11)
------------------
This new release includes several backwards-incompatible changes, mostly because features were removed from the
public API or have been renamed to obtain a more consistent API.

It was released after a long time of development, and does not even contain all features that were originally
planned to go into this release, but it contains some important bugfixes that warranted a release.

New major features:

* Add volume shadow copy support for NTFS
* Add BDE (Bitlocker) support
* Addition of :option:`--keys` CLI argument and corresponding argument to Volume class, allowing to specify key
  material for crypto mounts, supporting both BDE and LUKS.
* (Experimental) support for volume systems inside a volume. This is useful when e.g. a LVM volume contains in
  itself a MBR.
* A split between detection and initialization of volumes has been made. The basic way to access volumes as calling
  :func:`init`, but that mounted all volumes immediately. Now, ``detect_*`` methods have been added.
* Support ``blkid`` to retrieve FS type info
* Support for Linux RAID volumes
* (Still in development) interactive console, which will eventually become the primary means to interact with
  imagemounter.

Bugfixes:

* Calling :func:`init` will not automatically mount the volume when it is not ``alloc``.
* Fix a bug where ``.e01`` files (lowercase) would not be recognized as Encase
* Fixed support for newer versions of ``mmls``
* Fixed support for pytsk3 under Python 3 (contributed by insomniacslk)
* Fixed support for EnCase v7 (EX01) image files (contributed by pix)
* Improved detection of several volume types
* :attr:`index` is now always ``str``
* :attr:`Volume.size` is now always ``int``
* Improved the unmounter with generic loopback support

Removed and modified features:

* Stopped providing :const:`None` and :const:`False` results when things go wrong for most methods. Instead,
  numerous exceptions have been added. These exceptions should be catched instead, or when using ``mount_volumes``
  or ``init``, you can specify ``swallow_exceptions`` (default) to restore previous behaviour. This is useful, since
  iteration will continue regardless of exceptions.
* Moved the attributes ``fstypes``, ``vstypes``, ``keys``, ``mountdir`` and ``pretty`` to the ``ImageParser`` instance,
  so it does not need to get passed down through the ``*args`` hack anymore. For instance, ``fstypes`` has been moved;
  the dict will be inspected upon Volume instantiation and stored in the ``fstype`` attribute. Other arguments and
  attributes have been eliminated completely, or have been replaced by arguments to specific methods.
* Added an intermediary class :class:`VolumeSystem`. Both :class:`Volume` and :class:`Disk` now use this (iterable)
  base class in their :attr:`volumes` attribute. If you relied on :attr:`volumes` being a ``list``, you should now
  use ``list(volumes)``. If you relied on indexing of the attribute, you could now also use ``disk[0]`` or ``volume[0]``
  for finding the correct volume index. :attr:`volume_source` was moved to this class, as have :attr:`vstype` and
  :attr:`volume_detector`.

* Changes to the CLI:
   * Removed :option:`--fsforce` and :option:`--fsfallback`. Use ``*`` and ``?`` as fstypes instead for the same effect.
     This should make the CLI more sensible, especially regarding the :option:`--fsforce` argument. The default FS
     fallback is still ``unknown``, which can only be overridden by specifying ``--fstypes=?=none``. (You can now
     specify ``--fstypes=TYPE``, which equals to ``--fstypes=*=TYPE``)
   * Removed ``--stats`` and ``--no-stats``. These only complicated things and ``fsstat`` has been working fine for
     years now.
   * Removed ``--raid`` and ``--no-raid`` (due to Volume RAID support)
   * Removed ``--disktype`` and ``--no-disktype``.
   * Renamed ``--method`` to ``--disk-mounter``.
   * Renamed ``--detection`` to ``--volume-detector``.
   * Renamed ``--vstype`` to ``--vstypes``, now accepting a dict, similar to ``--fstypes``
   * Moved the ``imount.py`` file into a new ``cli`` module, where also a new experimental shell-style CLI is under
     development.

* Changes specific to :class:`ImageParser`:
   * Added ``add_disk`` and made ``paths`` optional in constructor.
   * Added indexing of the `ImageParser` and added ``get_volume_by_index`` method.
   * Removed ``mount_single_volume`` and ``mount_multiple_volumes``. Use ``init_volumes`` instead, or use a custom
     loop for more control.
   * Dropped support for a single string argument for ``paths`` in ``__init__``. Additionally, dropped the ``paths``
     attribute entirely.

* Changes specific to :class:`Disk`:
   * Renamed ``method`` to ``disk_mounter`` (see also CLI)
   * Removed ``name``, ``avfs_mountpoint`` and ``md_device`` from public API.
   * Removed Linux RAID Disk support. Instead, mount as a single volume, with the type of this volume being RAID.
     This greatly simplifies the :class:`Disk` class. (This means that :attr:`loopback` has also been dropped from Disk)
   * Added ``detect_volumes`` method, which can be used to detect volumes.
   * Removed most ``mount_*`` methods. Moved ``mount_volumes`` to ``init_volumes``. Functionality from the other methods
     can be restored with only a few lines of code.
   * Removed the need for the rather obsure ``multifile`` attribute of ``mount``. Only ``xmount`` actually required
     this, so we just implicitly use it there.
   * Moved the ``type`` attribute to a method ``get_disk_type``.

* Changes specific to :class:`Volume`:
   * Renamed ``get_raw_base_path`` to ``get_raw_path``
   * Renamed ``get_size_gib`` to ``get_formatted_size``
   * Removed ``get_magic_type``, ``fill_stats``, ``open_jffs2``, ``find_lvm_volumes`` and ``open_luks_container``
     from public API.
   * Removed the ``*_path``, ``carvepoint`` and ``bindmountpoint`` attributes from the public API. For ``carvepoint``,
     the ``carve`` method now returns the path to the carvepoint. All data has been moved to the private ``_paths``
     attribute. The ``mountpoint`` and ``loopback`` attributes are kept.
   * Removed ``fsforce`` and ``fsfallback`` arguments and attributes from Volume (see also CLI)
   * Added ``init_volume``, which only mounts the single volume. It is used by ``init`` and the preferred way of
     mounting a single volume (instead of using ``mount``)
   * Moved several attributes of :class:`Volume` to a new :attr:`info` attribute, which is publicly accessible, but
     its contents are not part of a stable public API.

* Changes specific to :class:`VolumeSystem` (if you consider it on par with the functionality moved from Disk):
   * Renamed ``detection`` to ``volume_detector`` (see also CLI)
   * Added a :func:`VolumeSystem.detect_volumes` iterable, which is the basic functionality of this class.
   * Moved ``mount_single_volume`` code from :class:`Disk` to this class, adding the ``single`` volume detection
     method. The directory detection method has been incorporated in this new method.

* Dropped support for Python 3.2, since everyone seems to be doing that these days.
