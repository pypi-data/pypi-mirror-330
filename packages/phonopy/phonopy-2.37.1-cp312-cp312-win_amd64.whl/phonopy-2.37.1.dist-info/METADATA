# Phonopy

Phonon code mainly written in python. Phonopy user documentation is found at
http://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/

## Installation

See https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/install.html.

## Mailing list for questions

Usual phonopy questions should be sent to phonopy mailing list
(https://sourceforge.net/p/phonopy/mailman/).

## Development

The development of phonopy is managed on the `develop` branch of github phonopy
repository.

- Github issues is the place to discuss about phonopy issues.
- Github pull request is the place to request merging source code.

### Formatting

Formatting rules are found in `pyproject.toml`.

### pre-commit

Pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/) is mainly used for applying the formatting
rules automatically. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged to use it at or before
git-commit. Pre-commit is set-up and used in the following way:

- Installed by `pip install pre-commit`, `conda install pre_commit` or see
  https://pre-commit.com/#install.
- pre-commit hook is installed by `pre-commit install`.
- pre-commit hook is run by `pre-commit run --all-files`.

Unless running pre-commit, pre-commit.ci may push the fix at PR by github
action. In this case, the fix should be merged by the contributor's repository.

### VSCode setting
- Not strictly, but VSCode's `settings.json` may be written like below

  ```json
  "ruff.lint.args": [
      "--config=${workspaceFolder}/pyproject.toml",
  ],
  "[python]": {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
      "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
          "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
      }
  },
  ```

## Documentation

Phonopy user documentation is written using python sphinx. The source files are
stored in `doc` directory. Please see how to write the documentation at
`doc/README.md`.

## How to run tests

Tests are written using pytest. To run tests, pytest has to be installed. The
tests can be run by

```bash
% pytest
```
