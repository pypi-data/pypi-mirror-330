    A sys.settrace–based tracer that:
      1. Only traces lines in a file whose name contains a specified indicator.
      2. At the first line of each function, pushes a "Call: funcName()" node and resets the conditional stack.
      3. For each line starting with one of the conditional keywords, uses its indentation to determine nesting:
         - Pops from the conditional stack until the current indent is greater.
         - Then, if that exact condition (same line text) hasn’t been added at that level, adds a new conditional node.
         - The conditional stack holds tuples (indent, node) so that nested conditionals are grouped.
      4. For lines containing a recognized query method (like ".filter(" or ".order_by("),
         creates a node with that line.
         - Such nodes (and any diff nodes) are added to the deepest active conditional node (if any),
           otherwise to the current function’s node.
      5. Then it checks all local variables for SQLAlchemy Query objects (those with “statement” and “session”):
         - For a new query, the baseline is "" (empty string) so the diff shows all new SQL.
         - If the new SQL differs from the baseline, a unified diff is computed and attached to the recognized node
           (or added as a new node), and the baseline is updated.
