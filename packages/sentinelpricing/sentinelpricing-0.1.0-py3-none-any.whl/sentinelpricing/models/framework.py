class Framework(abc.ABC):
    """
    Base class for the Sentinel Rating Framework.

    This abstract base class is the core of the rating framework system.
    It is designed for generating quotes based on test cases provided by the
    user.

    Derived classes should implement the `setup` and `calculation` methods to
    configure the framework and perform quote calculations, respectively.

    Frameworks are never intended to be initialised by the end user. You should
    be calling the class methods 'quote' and 'quote_many'. In addition, set up
    methods from parent classes are inherited and executed in order during
    instantiation. This allows frameworks to build on one another without
    overriding crucial initialization steps.

    Example:
        class YourFramework(Framework):
            def setup(self):
                # Load rating tables and initialize resources
                ...

            def calculation(self, quote):
                # Perform quote calculation logic
                ...

        class YourFrameworkVersion2(YourFramework):
            def setup(self):
                # Additional initialization for version 2
                ...
            def calculation(self, quote):
                # Overridden calculation logic for version 2
                ...
