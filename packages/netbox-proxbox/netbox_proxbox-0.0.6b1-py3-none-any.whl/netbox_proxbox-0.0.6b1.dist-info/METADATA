> Although **Proxbox is under constant development**, I do it with **best effort** and **spare time**. I have no financial gain with this and hope you guys understand, as I know it is pretty useful to some people. If you want to **speed up its development**, solve the problem or create new features with your own code and create a **[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)** so that I can **review** it. **I also would like to appreciate the people who already contributed with code or/and bug reports.** Without this help, surely Proxbox would be much less useful as it is already today to several environments!

## Netbox Plugin which integrates [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) and [Netbox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/)!

> **NOTE:** Although the Proxbox plugin is in development, it only use **GET requests** and there is **no risk to harm your Proxmox environment** by changing things incorrectly.

<br>

Proxbox is currently able to get the following information from Proxmox:

- **Cluster name**
- **Nodes:**
  - Status (online / offline)
  - Name
- **Virtual Machines and Containers:**
  - Status (online / offline)
  - Name
  - ID
  - CPU
  - Disk
  - Memory
  - Node (Server)

## 1. Installation

The instructions below detail the process for installing and enabling Proxbox plugin.
The plugin is available as a Python package in pypi and can be installed with pip.

### 1.1. Install package

#### 1.1.1. Using pip (production use)

> NOT WORKING

Enter Netbox's virtual environment.
```
source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate
```

Install the plugin package.

> It will automatically install `proxbox_api` (plugin backend) and `pynetbox-api` (the lib used to communicate with NetBox API)

```
pip install netbox-proxbox
```

Start Proxbox Backend (FastAPI app)

```
systemctl start proxbox
```

If failing to start the systemd service, try using the following command to see the error messages:

```
uvicorn proxbox_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8800 --reload
```

#### 1.1.2. Using git (development use)

> CURRENTLY WORKING

**OBS:** This method is recommend for testing and development purposes and is not for production use.

Move to netbox main folder
```
cd /opt/netbox/netbox
```

Clone netbox-proxbox repository
```
git clone https://github.com/netdevopsbr/netbox-proxbox.git
```

Install required packages

```
cd /opt/netbox
source venv/bin/activate
cd netbox/netbox-proxbox

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run pynetbox-api on [develop mode (editable)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#editable-dependencies) using astral-uv
```
uv add --editable ./your-path-to-package/pynetbox-api
```

Run netbox-proxbox on develop mode

```
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

**(NEW) Install pynetbox-api package in development mode**

- You must be on `netbox-proxbox` root folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/emersonfelipesp/pynetbox-api.git
python3 -m pip install pynetbox-api/ -e .
```

Or clone it to a totally different repository like `/opt` and use `uv` to build it as development
```
uv pip install -e "pynetbox_api @ /opt/pynetbox-api"
```

**OBS:** For now, you must manually configure `.env` on `pynetbox-api` root folder with NetBox URL and Token

---

### 1.2. Enable the Plugin

Enable the plugin in **/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py**:
```python
PLUGINS = ['netbox_proxbox']
```


### 1.3. Configure Plugin

All plugin configuration is now done using NetBox GUI or its API. You can check the old configuration way [here](./PAST_CONFIG.md).

---

### 1.4. Run Database Migrations

```
(venv) $ cd /opt/netbox/netbox/
(venv) $ python3 manage.py migrate netbox_proxbox
(venv) $ python3 manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

---

### 1.5. systemd Setup (Proxbox Backend)

**OBS:** It is possible to change Proxbox Backend Port (`8800`), you need to edit `proxbox.service` file and `configuration.py`

Enables **read/exec permission** for **Uvicorn** use **Netbox certificates**. This is a generic way of doing it and probably **not** the **safe** option.
```
sudo chmod +rx -R /etc/ssl/private/
sudo chmod +rx -R /etc/ssl/certs/
```

Copies `proxbox.service` from repository to **systemd folder** and enables it.
```
sudo cp -v /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox-proxbox/contrib/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now proxbox

sudo systemctl start proxbox
sudo systemctl status proxbox
```

The commands above creates the service file, enables it to run at boot time and starts it immediately.

#### Optional way for developing use:

The certificates used are from Netbox, considering both applications are on the same machine.
If you plan to put Proxbox Backend in another host, I recommend creating another pair of certificates and enabling NGINX in front ot it.

```
/opt/netbox/venv/bin/uvicorn netbox-proxbox.proxbox_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8800 --app-dir /opt/netbox/netbox --ssl-keyfile=/etc/ssl/private/netbox.key --ssl-certfile=/etc/ssl/certs/netbox.crt --reload
```

#### (Developer Use Only) Creating self-signed certificates so Proxbox Backend (FastAPI) runs both HTTP and WS (Websocket) via TLS.

If you need to test the plugin without reusing Netbox certificates, you can create your own self-signed certificates and change systemd file.

```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
-keyout /etc/ssl/proxbox.key \
-out /etc/ssl/proxbox.crt
```

> The certificate files created are by default located at `/etc/ssl`.
> Proxbox SystemD file needs to be changed to link to this path to find `proxbox.key` and `proxbox.crt` files.
> Consider use some HTTP Proxy like NGINX to serve FastAPI.

---

### 1.6. Restart WSGI Service

Restart the WSGI service to load the new plugin:
```
# sudo systemctl restart netbox
```

---

## 2. Usage

If everything is working correctly, you should see in Netbox's navigation the **Proxmox VM/CT** button in **Plugins** dropdown list.

On **Proxmox VM/CT** page, click button ![full update button](etc/img/proxbox_full_update_button.png?raw=true "preview")

It will redirect you to a new page and you just have to wait until the plugin runs through all Proxmox Cluster and create the VMs and CTs in Netbox.

**OBS:** Due the time it takes to full update the information, your web brouse might show a timeout page (like HTTP Code 504) even though it actually worked.

---

## 3. Enable Logs

So that Proxbox plugin logs what is happening to the terminal, copy the following code and paste to `configuration.py` Netbox configuration file:

```python
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'root': {
        'handlers': ['console'],
        'level': 'INFO',
    },
}
```

You can customize this using the following link: [Django Docs - Logging](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/logging/).
Although the above standard configuration should do the trick to things work.

---

## 4. Roadmap
- [X] Start using custom models to optimize the use of the Plugin and stop using 'Custom Fields'
- [ ] Automatically remove Nodes on Netbox when removed on Promox (as it already happens with Virtual Machines and Containers)
- [ ] Add individual update of VM/CT's and Nodes (currently is only possible to update all at once)
- [ ] Add periodic update of the whole environment so that the user does not need to manually click the update button.
- [ ] Create virtual machines and containers directly on Netbox, having no need to access Proxmox.
- [ ] Add 'Console' button to enable console access to virtual machines
