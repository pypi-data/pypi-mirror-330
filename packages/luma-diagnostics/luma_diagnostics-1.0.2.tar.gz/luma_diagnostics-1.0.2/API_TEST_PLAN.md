# LUMA API Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan outlines the comprehensive API testing strategy for the LUMA Dream Machine API, focusing on image and video generation capabilities.

## Test Categories

### 1. Authentication & Authorization 
- [x] Validate token format and structure
- [x] Test token expiration handling
- [x] Verify permission scopes
- [x] Test invalid token scenarios
- [x] Check rate limit headers

### 2. Image Source Testing 
- [x] Test with AWS S3 hosted image
- [x] Test with Google Cloud Storage hosted image
- [x] Test with GitHub raw content
- [x] Test with clean IP (non-blacklisted) host
- [x] Test with CDN-served images

### 3. Image Quality Variations 
- [x] Test with progressive JPEG
- [x] Test with standard JPEG
- [x] Test with varying compression qualities
- [x] Test with embedded ICC profiles
- [x] Test with different EXIF metadata

### 4. Generation Tests 
- [x] Text-to-Image Generation
  - [x] Default prompts
  - [x] Custom prompts
  - [x] Style variations
  - [x] Model selection
- [x] Image-to-Image Generation
  - [x] Style transfer
  - [x] Image modifications
  - [x] Reference images
  - [x] Character references
- [x] Image-to-Video Generation
  - [x] Camera motions
  - [x] Duration settings
  - [x] Quality settings
  - [x] Frame rate options

### 5. Concurrency & Rate Limits 
- [x] Test concurrent requests (2, 5, 10 simultaneous)
- [x] Test rapid sequential requests
- [x] Test rate limit boundaries
- [x] Test backoff behavior
- [x] Monitor rate limit headers

### 6. Error Handling 
- [x] Test with invalid image URLs
- [x] Test with temporary network issues
- [x] Test with malformed requests
- [x] Test with oversized images
- [x] Document all error responses

### 7. Edge Cases 
- [x] Test with maximum allowed image size
- [x] Test with minimum allowed image size
- [x] Test with various aspect ratios
- [x] Test with extreme prompt lengths
- [x] Test with special characters in prompts

## Test Results

### Success Metrics
- All API endpoints respond correctly
- Generation requests complete successfully
- Error responses are properly formatted
- Rate limits are properly enforced
- Assets are accessible and valid

### Documentation
- See `docs/GENERATION_TESTS.md` for detailed generation test documentation
- See `README.md` for general usage and setup
- See individual test results in `results/` directory

## Future Improvements
