   - Create a file named `.env` in your home directory
   - Add the line: `LUMA_API_KEY=your_api_key`

3. **Command line argument**:
   - Pass your API key with each command: `luma-diagnostics --api-key your_api_key --test`

4. **Wizard input**:
   - The wizard will prompt you to enter your API key if needed
