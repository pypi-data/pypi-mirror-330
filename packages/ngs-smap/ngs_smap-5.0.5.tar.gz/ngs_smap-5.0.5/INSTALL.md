# Installation

## Prerequisites
This manual presumes that you have access to the following: 
* A running linux distribution with python3 installed
* Administrator privileges (sudo rights)
* A working internet connection

## Downloading the software
The latest release of the software can be obtained from https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap/-/releases. If you are familiar with Git, we make sure the latest release matches the contents of the master branch (https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap). However, sometimes one would like to use the latest and greatest developments. These development versions are available in the 'dev' branch (https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap/tree/dev). Thus, the software can be downloaded using three ways:

* Downloading the release: using the browser, or using `wget`.
* Downloading the master branch using the command line (git): `git clone https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap.git`
* Getting the latest developments: `git clone https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap.git; git checkout dev`

## Installing dependencies
The scripts included in this software depend on a couple of python packages, together with the bedtools software. Installing bedtools requires administrator privileges, while installing the python packages can be done in virtual environments. 

### bedtools
This software ships [BEDtools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2), which is covered by an MIT license.

### Python packages.
As noted above, the package dependencies from python can be installed in virtual environments, allowing these dependencies to be installed without administrator privileges and for a single user only. According to the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), a virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. Creating a virtual environment for python3 is pretty straightforward:

```{bash}
python3 -m venv <environment_folder_name> 
```
The above commands will create a hidden folder `<environment_folder_name>` which contains the new virtual environment. This local environment has the same structure as the global python environment. For example, a python executable can be found in `<environment_folder_name>/bin/`. However, it is not necessary to adjust scripts to point to the python executable in this folder. Instead, python virtual environments can be activated to perform this adjustment automatically.


A virtual environment can be activated using 
```{bash}
source <environment_folder_name>/bin/activate
```
When activated, the `<environment_folder_name>/bin/` folder will be added to the linux PATH. As a consequence, for every python-related operation that the user performs, the activated virtual environment is used. This includes installing and removing software, running python, etc. Environments can also be activated from scripts, making it possible to install software into virtual environments and remove that virtual environment when the script finishes.

For installing python software, `pip` is used. By default pip will install packages from the Python Package Index, https://pypi.org. If packages are installed into a virtual environment, no sudo rights are required.Â For your convenience, all the python dependencies have been listed in a [requirements file](https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap/-/blob/master/meta.yaml). This list of requirements can be passed to `pip`, which will automatically install the dependencies.
By default, virtual environments can ship outdated pip versions. It is necessary to update pip before you continue, otherwise you might get an error that cython is not installed.
``` {bash}
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ngs-smap/
```

After you have finished your analysis in the virtual environment, you leave from the virtual environment by
```{bash}
deactivate
```

## Example installation

### Using pip

```{bash} 
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ngs-smap
```
If you also want to install SMAP haplotype-window and SMAP design:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ngs-smap
pip install smap-haplotype-window
pip install primer3-py biopython
## add commands to wget the utility python scripts from the repo's. ##
```
### Using Git
```{bash} 
git clone https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap.git
cd smap
git checkout master
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```
Or 
```bash
`git clone https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap.git ; cd smap ; git checkout master ; python3 -m venv .venv ; source .venv/bin/activate ; pip install --upgrade pip ; pip install .`
```
If you also want to install SMAP haplotype-window:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap.git
cd smap
git checkout master
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
cd ..
git clone https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-haplotype-window
cd smap-haplotype-window
git checkout master
pip install .
```

or 

```bash
`git clone https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-haplotype-window ; cd smap ; git checkout master ; python3 -m venv .venv ; source .venv/bin/activate ; pip install --upgrade pip ; pip install . ; cd .. ; git clone https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-haplotype-window ; cd smap-haplotype-window ; git checkout master ; pip install .`
```
If you also want to install SMAP haplotype-window and SMAP design:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap.git
cd smap
git checkout master
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
cd ..
git clone https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-haplotype-window
cd smap-haplotype-window
git checkout master
pip install .
cd ..
git clone  https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-design.git
cd smap-design
pip install primer3-py biopython
# The required packages pandas and matplotlib are already included in the main SMAP package installation above. If SMAP design is installed by itself, then also run:
pip install pandas matplotlib
## add commands to wget the utility python scripts from the repo's. ##
```

or 

```bash
`git clone https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-haplotype-window ; cd smap ; git checkout master ; python3 -m venv .venv ; source .venv/bin/activate ; pip install --upgrade pip ; pip install . ; cd .. ; git clone https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-haplotype-window ; cd smap-haplotype-window ; git checkout master ; pip install . ; cd .. ; git clone  https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-design.git ; cd smap-design ; pip install primer3-py biopython ; pip install pandas matplotlib`
```

### Using Docker
A docker container is available on dockerhub. 
To pull the docker image and run SMAP using Docker, use:

```bash
docker run ilvo/smap --help
```

It is currently not possible to install SMAP design and SMAP haplotype-window using docker.

# Removing smap
Uninstalling smap is a matter of removing the virtual environment and uninstalling `bedtools`. For example:
```{bash}
rm -r .venv
```
