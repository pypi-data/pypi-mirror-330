## Using wiliot-deployment-tools
This package includes the following CLI Utilities:
### Automatic Configuration Tool
Automatically connects to all Gateways / Bridges in the location specified, and configure them to optimal parameters.

```
usage: wlt-config -owner OWNER -location LOCATION [-ota] [-no_gp_zone] [-pacing_interval PACING_INTERVAL] [-ignore_bridges [IGNORE_BRIDGES [IGNORE_BRIDGES ...]]] [--expected_num_brgs EXPECTED_NUM_BRGS]

required arguments:
  -owner OWNER         Platform owner id
  -location LOCATION   Location name in Wiliot platform. If location has ' ' in name, input location wrapped with double quotes: --location "LOCATION NAME"

additional (optional) arguments:
  -ota         Updating FW version to latest for all devices
  -no_gp_zone          don't use Global pacing group by zone (all bridges will be GPG=0)
  -pacing_interval PACING_INTERVAL
                        Pacing interval for all devices
  -ignore_bridges [IGNORE_BRIDGES [IGNORE_BRIDGES ...]]
                        bridges to ignore in the tool - their configuration won't be changed
  -expected_num_brgs EXPECTED_NUM_BRGS
                        Number of expected bridges in location. The tool will try to connect to all bridges (excluding those specified in ignore bridges) until reaching expected number.

### Gateway Certificate
Test Wiliot GWs capabilities.
The GW Certificate includes different test that run sequentially to test each capability reported by the GW.
To run the GW Certificate the GW needs to use a public MQTT Broker (HiveMQ):

Host:	broker.hivemq.com
TCP Port:	1883
Websocket Port:	8000
TLS TCP Port:	8883
TLS Websocket Port:	8884

More information can be found at https://www.mqtt-dashboard.com/.

#### Connection Test
Processes status packet sent by the GW to the MQTT Broker and validates it according to API Version.

#### Uplink Test
Simulates Wiliot MEL and validates that data is uploaded correctly to the cloud.

#### Downlink Test
Sends advertising packets via MQTT to GW and validates correct advertising by GW.

#### Stress Test
Increments time delays between packets to evaluate GW's capability in handling increasing packets per second within a minute.

### MacOS Installation
#### Getting around SSL issue on Mac with Python 3.7 and later versions

Python version 3.7 on Mac OS has stopped using the OS's version of SSL and started using Python's implementation instead. As a result, the CA
certificates included in the OS are no longer usable. To avoid getting SSL related errors from the code when running under this setup you need
to execute Install Certificates.command Python script. Typically you will find it under
~~~~
/Applications/Python\ 3.7/Install\ Certificates.command
~~~~

-----------------

#### Python 3 on MacOS
The default Python version on mac is 2.x. Since Wiliot package requires Python 3.x you should download Python3 
(e.g.  Python3.7) and make python 3 your default.
There are many ways how to do it such as add python3 to your PATH (one possible solution https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-the-path-variable-in-mac)
