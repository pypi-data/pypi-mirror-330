# ModelScout

**ModelScout** is a command-line tool designed to help users pick the best LLM for their needs. Modelscout uses a similar recommendation algorithm as to [Macros On Demand](https://github.com/Hadi-M-Ibrahim/Macros-On-Demand) a more in-depth example of my SWE work. While ModelScout is simple it serves as a useful stop-gap in the quickly evolving field of LLMs. As the name suggests ModelScout is simply a scout and should serve as the beginning, not the end of your LLM search.

Subjective metrics such as performance and the degree to which a model is supported are gathered from various sources and forums (ie. Benchmarks, Reddit, Google trends. etc) and are based largely on community sentiment so should be taken with a grain of salt. Further note the cost per million tokens for open source models are very rough estimates with varying accuracy.
