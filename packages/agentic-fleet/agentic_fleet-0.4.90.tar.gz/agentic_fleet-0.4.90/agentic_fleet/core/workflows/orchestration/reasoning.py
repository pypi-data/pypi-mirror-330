Agentic Reasoning Module

This module provides foundational functionalities for agentic reasoning,
inspired by the world of agents and advanced chain-of-thought patterns as
outlined in https://github.com/theworldofagents/Agentic-Reasoning.git.

Key Features:
1. Chain-of-thought generation
2. Self-reflection and introspection
3. Dynamic planning and critique mechanisms for multi-agent collaboration
4. Integration utilities to support specialized agents (Mind Map, Web Search, Coding)

The functions here can be used as mixins or standalone utilities to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of agents within the AgenticFleet project.

All functions include comprehensive docstrings to support maintainability
and adherence to best practices.
