title: Tracing

## Overview ##

`judgeval`'s tracing module allows you to view your LLM application's execution from **end-to-end**. 

Using tracing, you can:
- Gain observability into **every layer of your agentic system**, from database queries to tool calling and text generation.
- Measure the performance of **each system component in any way** you want to measure it. For instance:
    - Catch regressions in **retrieval quality, factuality, answer relevance**, and 10+ other [**research-backed metrics**](/evaluation/scorers/introduction).
    - Quantify the **quality of each tool call** your agent makes
    - Track the latency of each system component
    - Count the token usage of each LLM generation
- Export your workflow runs to the Judgment platform for **real-time analysis** or as a dataset for [**offline experimentation**](/evaluation/introduction).


## Tracing Your Workflow ##

Setting up tracing with `judgeval` takes three simple steps:

### 1. Initialize a tracer with your API key

```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer

judgment = Tracer()  # loads from JUDGMENT_API_KEY env var
```

<Note>
    The [Judgment tracer](/api_reference/trace) is a singleton object that should be shared across your application.
</Note>


### 2. Wrap your workflow components

`judgeval` provides three wrapping mechanisms for your workflow components:

#### `wrap()` ####
The `wrap()` function goes over your LLM client (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and captures metadata surrounding your LLM calls, such as:
- Latency
- Token usage
- Prompt/Completion
- Model name

#### `@observe` ####
The `@observe` decorator wraps your functions/tools and captures metadata surrounding your function calls, such as:
- Latency
- Input/Output
- Span type (e.g. `retriever`, `tool`, `LLM call`, etc.)

Here's an example of using the `@observe` decorator on a function:
```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer

judgment = Tracer()  # loads from JUDGMENT_API_KEY env var

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def my_tool():
    print("Hello world!")

```

<Note>
    The `@observe` decorator is used on top of helper functions that you write, but is not designed to be used 
    on your "main" function. For more information, see the `context manager` section below.
</Note>

#### `context manager` ####

In your main function (e.g. the one that executes the primary workflow logic), you can use the `with judgment.trace()` context manager to trace the entire workflow.

The context manager can **save/print the state of the trace at any point in the workflow**.
This is useful for debugging or exporting any state of your workflow to run an evaluation from!

<Tip>
    The `with judgment.trace()` context manager detects any `@observe` decorated functions or wrapped LLM calls within the context and automatically captures their metadata.
</Tip>


#### Putting it all Together
Here's a complete example of using the `with judgment.trace()` context manager with the other tracing mechanisms:
```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = wrap(OpenAI())
judgment = Tracer()  # loads from JUDGMENT_API_KEY env var

@judgment.observe(span_type="tool")
def my_tool():
    return "Hello world!"

@judgment.observe(span_type="LLM call")
def my_llm_call():
    message = my_tool()
    res = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}]
    )
    return res.choices[0].message.content

def main():
    with judgment.trace(
        "main_workflow", 
        project_name="my_project"
    ) as trace:
        res = my_llm_call()
        trace.save()
        trace.print()
        return res
```

The printed trace appears as follows on the terminal:
```
→ main_workflow (trace: main_workflow)
  → my_llm_call (trace: my_llm_call)
    Input: {'args': [], 'kwargs': {}}
    → my_tool (trace: my_tool)
      Input: {'args': [], 'kwargs': {}}
      Output: Hello world!
    ← my_tool (0.000s)
    Output: Hello! How can I assist you today?
  ← my_llm_call (0.789s)
```

And the trace will appear on the Judgment platform as follows:

### 3. Running Production Evaluations

Optionally, you can run asynchronous evaluations directly inside your traces.

This enables you to run evaluations on your **production data in real-time**, which can be useful for:
- **Guardrailing your production system** against quality regressions (hallucinations, toxic responses, revealing private data, etc.).
- Exporting production data for **offline experimentation** (e.g for A/B testing your workflow versions on relevant use cases).
- Getting **actionable insights** on how to fix common failure modes in your workflow (e.g. missing knowledge base info, suboptimal prompts, etc.). 

To execute an asynchronous evaluation, you can use the `trace.async_evaluate()` method. Here's an example of that:

```python
from judgeval.common.tracer import Tracer
from judgeval.scorers import FaithfulnessScorer

judgment = Tracer()

def main():
    with judgment.trace(
        "main_workflow", 
        project_name="my_project"
    ) as trace:
        retrieved_info = ...   # from knowledge base
        res = ...  # your main workflow logic
        
        judgment.get_current_trace().async_evaluate(
            scorers=[FaithfulnesssScorer(threshold=0.5)],
            input="",
            actual_output=res,
            retrieval_context=[retrieved_info],
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
        )
        return res
```

<Tip>
You can organize how your async evaluation runs are logged to the Judgment platform by using the 
`project_name` argument in the `trace` context manager. See our [API documentation](/api_reference/trace) 
for more information.

## Example: OpenAI Travel Agent

In this video, we'll walk through all of the topics covered in this guide by tracing over a simple OpenAI travel agent.
