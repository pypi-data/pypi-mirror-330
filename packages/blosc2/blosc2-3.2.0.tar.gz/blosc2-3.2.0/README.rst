What it is
==========

Python-Blosc2 is a high-performance compressed ndarray library with a flexible
compute engine.  It uses the C-Blosc2 library as the compression backend.
`C-Blosc2 <https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2>`_ is the next generation of
Blosc, an `award-winning <https://www.blosc.org/posts/prize-push-Blosc2/>`_
library that has been around for more than a decade, and that is been used
by many projects, including `PyTables <https://www.pytables.org/>`_ or
`Zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

Python-Blosc2 is Python wrapper that exposes the C-Blosc2 API, *plus* an
integrated compute engine. This allows to perform complex calculations on
compressed data in a way that operands do not need to be in-memory, but can be
stored on disk or on `the network <https://github.com/ironArray/Caterva2>`_.
This makes possible to work with data no matter how large it is, and that
can be stored in a distributed fashion.

Most importantly, Python-Blosc2 uses the `C-Blosc2 simple and open format
<https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/blob/main/README_FORMAT.rst>`_ for storing
compressed data, making it easy to integrate with other systems and tools.

You can find more introductory info about Python-Blosc2 at:

https://www.blosc.org/python-blosc2/getting_started/overview.html

Installing
==========

Blosc2 now provides Python wheels for the major OS (Win, Mac and Linux) and platforms.
You can install the binary packages from PyPi using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install blosc2 --upgrade

For conda users, you can install the package from the conda-forge channel:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install -c conda-forge python-blosc2

Documentation
=============

The documentation is available here:

https://blosc.org/python-blosc2/python-blosc2.html

Additionally, you can find some examples at:

https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc2/tree/main/examples

Finally, we taught a tutorial at the `PyData Global 2024 <https://pydata.org/global2024/>`_
that you can find at: https://github.com/Blosc/Python-Blosc2-3.0-tutorial.  There you will
find different Jupyter notebook that explains the main features of Python-Blosc2.

In addition, other people have participated to the project in different
aspects:

- Jan Sellner, contributed the mmap support for NDArray/SChunk objects.
- Dimitri Papadopoulos, contributed a large bunch of improvements to the
  in many aspects of the project.  His attention to detail is remarkable.
- And many others that have contributed with bug reports, suggestions and
  improvements.
