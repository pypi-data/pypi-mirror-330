## ECTOR

Extract from a given long text input, eCommerce products and price budget.

### DISCLAIMER

This is not an "OpenAI wrapper", it use NLP(Natural Language Processing)
and tokens manipulations to 'understand the given input' then extract product
key name + budget.

Therefore, this is not 100% optimized at all and was not tested on extreme edge-cases.
However it's quite fast and does the job for my use case at the moment.
