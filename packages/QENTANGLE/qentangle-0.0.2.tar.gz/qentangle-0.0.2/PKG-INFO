QEntangle Quantum Education Library
==========================
A simple Python 3.11 library to introduce quantum computing concepts to G6-12/post-secondary students.  A companion to the Entangled: Jasmine & the Quantum Sword educational program by the Center for Science Engagement. 
This library provides basic quantum gates, quantum circuits, and entanglement operations.

Features:
---------
- Basic quantum gates: Identity, Hadamard, Pauli-X, CNOT
- Bell state creation
- GHZ state creation
- Quantum circuit simulation
- Ongoing additions and improvements particularly in visualizations, games
