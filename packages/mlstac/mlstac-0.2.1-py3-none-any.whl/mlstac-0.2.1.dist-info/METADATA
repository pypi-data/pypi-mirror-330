LML models with few lines of code

- **Github repository**: <https://github.com/csaybar/isp-models/>
- **Documentation** <https://csaybar.github.io/isp-models/>

## Getting started with your project

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:csaybar/isp-models.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
make install
```

You are now ready to start development on your project!
The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.
