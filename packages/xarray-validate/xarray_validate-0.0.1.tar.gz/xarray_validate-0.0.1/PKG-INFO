## Motivation

> This is a maintained refactor of
> [xarray-schema](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-schema).
> I needed an xarray validation engine for one of my projects. In saw in the
> xarray-schema library a good start, but both its maintenance status and the
> foreseen integration of its feature set into the much larger Pandera library
> seemed uncertain. I therefore decided to fork the project, refactor it and add
> the features I was missing.

## Features

* ⬆️ DataArray and Dataset validation
* ⬆️ Basic Python type serialization / deserialization
* Construct schema from existing xarray data
* 🚫 ~~JSON roundtrip~~ (not guaranteed to work)

⬆️ Inherited from xarray-schema
🚫 Won't do / won't fix
