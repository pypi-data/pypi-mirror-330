## Railway Deployment

IndoxRouter is ready to be deployed on Railway. Follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

2. Create a new project on Railway and connect it to your GitHub repository.

3. Add the following environment variables in Railway:

   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure secret key for JWT tokens
   - Provider API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.)

4. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile and deploy your application.

5. Once deployed, you can access your API at the URL provided by Railway.

## Detailed Documentation

For detailed deployment instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting, please refer to the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## API Usage

### Authentication

1. Register a new user through the API.
2. Generate an API key for the user.
3. Use the API key in your requests.

### Making Requests

```python
import requests

api_key = "your_api_key"
url = "http://localhost:8000/v1/completions"

payload = {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "prompt": "Hello, world!",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 100
}

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

## Client Library

IndoxRouter includes a Python client library for easy integration:

```python
from indoxRouter.client import Client

client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")

response = client.completions(
    provider="openai",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    prompt="Hello, world!",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=100
)

print(response)
```
