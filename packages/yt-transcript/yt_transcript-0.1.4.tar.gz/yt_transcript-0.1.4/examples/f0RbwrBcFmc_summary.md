Lance from LangChain discusses the evolution of AI reasoning models, emphasizing the shift from next-word prediction to more complex reasoning tasks. He explains how Chain of Thought prompting allows models to handle difficult problems by enforcing step-by-step reasoning, akin to system two thinking. The new scaling paradigm involves reinforcement learning to optimize model outputs based on correct answers, leading to rapid improvements in performance. Additionally, he highlights the importance of clear prompting strategies for these models, focusing on specifying desired outcomes rather than instructing on reasoning methods.

The section discusses various applications of AI reasoning models, highlighting their effectiveness in coding, planning workflows, data analysis, and research generation. It emphasizes that while chat models are suited for interactive tasks, reasoning models excel in background processes, enabling deep analysis without requiring immediate user interaction. Notable use cases include analyzing medical data, summarizing meeting notes, and monitoring social media trends. Overall, the potential for integrating these models into existing applications is promising and encourages user feedback.
