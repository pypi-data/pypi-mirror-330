List all the known genes directly and indirectly involved in the following biological process or cellular component """{descr}""" and a one sentence reason why they belong. Use the following JSON schema:
```json
{{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {{
            "gene": {{
                "type": "string",
            }},
            "reason": {{
                "type": "string",
            }}
        }},
        "required": ["gene", "reason"]
    }}
}}
```
The field `gene` is a gene involved in the following biological process or cellular component: """{descr}""". The field `reason` is a one sentence reason as to why the gene in `gene` belongs to the biological process or cellular component. Use the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene abbreviations. Place the output in a JSON code block. Do not add any comments in the JSON code block.
