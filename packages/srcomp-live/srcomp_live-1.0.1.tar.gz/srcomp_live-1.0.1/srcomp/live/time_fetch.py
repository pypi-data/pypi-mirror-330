Functions for fetching the current game time from supported APIs.

All functions must follow GAME_TIME_CALLABLE type signature.
As such, they must accept a single string argument (the API URL) and return a tuple.
The function must return a tuple containing the game time in seconds and the match number.
If a match is not currently running, both elements should be None.
