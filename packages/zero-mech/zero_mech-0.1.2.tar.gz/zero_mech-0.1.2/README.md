# ZeroMech - A 0D mechanics simulator

In this repo we implement simple 0D mechanics simulator.

## Install
You can install the package with python
```
python3 -m pip install zero-mech
```

## Quick start
Check of the [documentation](https://computationalphysiology.github.io/zero-mech/) for examples on how to use the simulator.

## Live demos
All demos can be run with [jupyterlite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) by going to https://computationalphysiology.github.io/zero-mech/lite

> [!NOTE]
> If you have issues running the demos in jupyterlite you can first try to restart the kernel by clicking the "Restart kernel" button in the toolbar. If you have issues with missing packages you can try to install the packages by running the following command in a code cell `%pip install package_name`
