# Sentiment and Query Intent Analysis Library

## Overview
This library provides tools for **sentiment analysis** and **query intent detection** using a fine-tuned **BERT-based model** to improve the emotional intelligence of your chatbot. The library enables sentiment classification at both **sentence** and **document** levels, as well as intent categorization most suited for educational chatbot conversations.

## Features
‚úÖ **Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis** - Classifies individual sentences as **Positive, Neutral, or Negative**.  
‚úÖ **Document-Level Sentiment Analysis** - Aggregates multiple sentences and determines the **overall sentiment**.  
‚úÖ **Query Intent Detection** - Identifies the **intent behind a query**, such as course information, class schedule, greetings
‚úÖ **Chat Summary Generation** - Provides  a summary table insights into chat sentiment and intent distribution.  
‚úÖ **Conversation Conversion & Analysis** - Converts chat logs initially in a json format into a csv format structured data with **sentiment, intent, and response time analysis** to be used to generate a dynamic dashboard on a website link: https://chatbot-dashboard-analysis.streamlit.app/ 
Keys needed in the chat log: _id,Person,stime_text,stime_timestamp,last_interact_text,last_interact_timestamp,llm_deployment_name,llm_model_name,vectorstore_index,overall_cost,overall_tokens,role,content,recorded_on_text,recorded_on_timestamp,token_cost,tokens,user_sentiment,query_intent,conversation_id,previous_query_intent,overall_chat,chat_sentiment,chatbot_response_time,overall_conversation_time

## Usage
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis**
Determine sentiment (**Positive, Neutral, Negative**) for a given sentence. This can return the sentiment of the user.
```python
from sentiment_analysis import sentiment_sentence

sentence = "I love this course!"
sentiment = sentiment_sentence(sentence)
print(sentiment)  # Output: Positive
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Document-Level Sentiment Analysis**
Analyze sentiment for a **collection of sentences** or a document. This gives back the sentiment at class level. The input should be in a dictionary format where the keys are the sentence number and values are the content
```python
from sentiment_analysis import sentiment_document

document = {"sentence1": "The class was great!", "sentence2": "I learned a lot."}
doc_sentiment = sentiment_document(document)
print(doc_sentiment)  # Output: Positive
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Query Intent Detection**
Classify the **intent behind a query** ("Course Overview and Information", "Course Assessment" , "Checking Announcement", "Request for Permission", "Learning Course Content",
 "Class Schedule", "Greetings", "Ending", "Casual Chat" , "No Query")
```python
from sentiment_analysis import query_intent

query = "Can I get more details on the assessment criteria?"
intent = query_intent(query)
print(intent)  # Output: Course Assessment
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate Chat Sentiment & Intent Summary**
Summarize sentiment and intent **for multiple sentences**. Use chat_summary if you want query intent to be included.
```python
from sentiment_analysis import chat_summary
from sentiment_analysis import sentiment_summary

document = {
    "sentence1": "I love this class!",
    "sentence2": "When is the next assignment due?"
}
summary = chat_summary(document)
summary = sentiment_summary(document)
print(summary)
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze and Convert Chat Logs**
Convert chatbot logs into structured data with **sentiment, intent, and response time analysis**.
```python
from sentiment_analysis import conversion

chatlog = {
    "chatlog": [
        {"_id": {"$oid": "1"}, "Person": "User1", "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "I'm very happy with the course!"},
            {"role": "ai", "content": "Glad to hear that!"}
        ]}
    ]
}

df = conversion(chatlog, num_of_chats=1)
print(df.head())
```
