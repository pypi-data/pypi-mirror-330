Metadata-Version: 2.1
Name: osm-map-merger
Version: 1.0.0
Summary: Tool for handling (negative) IDs and merging different OSM maps (e.g. Lanelet2 maps). Very helpful if you have modeled several maps separately and now want to merge them into a single map.

# OSM Map Merger

> **IMPORTANT NOTE** This repository is part of the _Behavior-Semantic Scenery Description (BSSD)_ framework. Check out our BSSD documentation and overview repository in your git of choice:

This tool can be used to handle one or more maps in OSM-format such as [Lanelet2 maps](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2) including the BSSD extension.

**Features:**
- Assign positive IDs to all elements and add a "version" attribute if missing. This is necessary after modification or creation of OSM-maps (e.g. with [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)) without synchronizing with the OSM database.
- Remap single negative IDs without changing the positive IDs.
- Merge multiple OSM input files into a single OSM output file. This works also for a mixture of positive and negative IDs.
- Elements with "action"="delete" will be ignored.

Use the ```--help``` command for more information about the [usage](#usage).
