**daidai üçä** is a minimalist, type-safe dependency management system for AI/ML components that streamlines workflow development with dependency injection, intelligent caching and seamless file handling.

üöß **daidai** is still very much a work in progress and is definitely not prod-ready. It is currently developed as a _[selfish software](https://every.to/source-code/selfish-software)_ to become my personal go-to MLOps library, but feel free to give it a try :) üöß

## Why daidai?

Built for both rapid prototyping and production ML workflows, **daidai üçä**:

- üöÄ **Accelerates Development** - Reduces iteration cycles with zero-config caching
- üß© **Simplifies Architecture** - Define reusable components with clear dependencies
- üîå **Works Anywhere** - Seamless integration with cloud/local storage via fsspec
- üß† **Stays Out of Your Way** - Type-hint based DI means minimal boilerplate
- üßπ **Manages Resources** - Automatic cleanup prevents leaks and wasted compute
- üõ°Ô∏è **Prioritizes Safety** - Strong typing catches issues at compile time, not runtime
- üß™ **Enables Testing** - Inject mock dependencies with ease for robust unit testing
- üéØ **Principle of Least Surprise** - Intuitive API that behaves exactly as you think it should work

> **daidai** is named after the Japanese word for "orange" üçä, a fruit that is both sweet and sour, just like the experience of managing dependencies in ML projects. <br/>It is being developed with user happiness in mind, while providing great flexibility and minimal boilerplate. It has been inspired by [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest), [modelkit](https://github.com/Cornerstone-OnDemand/modelkit), [dependency injection & testing](https://antoinejeannot.github.io/nuggets/dependency_injection_and_testing.html) principles and functional programming.

## Installation

```bash
pip install daidai
```

## Quick Start

```python
import base64
from typing import Annotated, Any

import openai

from daidai import ModelManager, artifact, predictor

# Define artifacts which are long-lived objects
# that can be used by multiple predictors, or other artifacts


@artifact
def openai_client(**configuration: dict[str, Any]) -> openai.OpenAI:
    return openai.OpenAI(**configuration)


# Fetch a distant file from HTTPS, but it can be from any source: local, S3, GCS, Azure, FTP, HF Hub, etc.
@artifact
def dogo_picture(
    picture: Annotated[
        bytes,
        "https://images.pexels.com/photos/220938/pexels-photo-220938.jpeg",
        {"cache_strategy": "no_cache"},
    ],
) -> str:
    return base64.b64encode(picture).decode("utf-8")


# Define a predictor that depends on the previous artifacts
# which are automatically loaded and passed as an argument


@predictor
def ask(
    message: str,
    dogo_picture: Annotated[str, dogo_picture],
    client: Annotated[openai.OpenAI, openai_client, {"timeout": 5}],
    model: str = "gpt-4o-mini",
) -> str:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {"type": "text", "text": message},
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{dogo_picture}",
                            "detail": "low",
                        },
                    },
                ],
            }
        ],
        model=model,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


# daidai takes care of loading dependencies & injecting artifacts!
print(ask("Hello, what's in the picture ?"))
# >>> The picture features a dog with a black and white coat.

# Or manage lifecycle with context manager for production usage
# all predictors, artifacts and files are automatically loaded and cleaned up
with ModelManager(preload=[ask]):
    print(ask("Hello, what's in the picture ?"))

# or manually pass dependencies
my_other_openai_client = openai.OpenAI(timeout=0.1)
print(ask("Hello, what's in the picture ?", client=my_other_openai_client))
# >>> openai.APITimeoutError: Request timed out.
# OOOPS, the new client timed out, of course :-)
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Clean things up now that the UX has landed
- [ ] Add docs
- [x] Use lock for file downloading
- [ ] Add support for async components
- [ ] Add a cookbook with common patterns & recipes
- [ ] Enjoy the fruits of my labor üçä

##  üßµ Concurrency & Parallelism

While file operations are protected against race conditions  (downloading, caching etc.), other operations **are not** due to the lazy nature of component loading.
As such, **daidai üçä** cannot be considered thread-safe (and does not plan to, at least in the short term).

However, there are ways to work around this limitation for multi-threaded applications:

1. Create a shared `ModelManager` instance for all threads, but ensure that components are loaded before the threads are started:

```python
@artifact
def model(model_path: Annotated[Path, "s3://bucket/model.pkl"]) -> Model:
    return pickle.load("model_a.pkl")

@predictor
def sentiment_classifier(text: str, model: Annotated[Model, model]):
    return model.predict(text)


with ModelManager(preload=[sentiment_classifier]) as manager:
    # sentiment_classifier and its dependencies (model) are loaded and
    # read to be used by all threads without issues
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(worker_function, data_chunks))
```

2. Create a separate `ModelManager` instance for each thread, each will benefit from the same disk cache but will not share components

```python
# same predictor & artifact definitions as above

def worker_function(data_chunk):
    # Each thread has its own manager and namespace
    with ModelManager(namespace=str(threading.get_ident())) as manager:
        return my_predictor(data)

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(worker_function, data_chunks))
```

A few notes:

- Creating separate ModelManager instances (approach #2) might lead to duplicate loading of the same components in memory across threads, while preloading (approach #1)
ensures components are shared but requires knowing & loading all components in advance.
- For most applications, approach #2 (separate managers) provides the safest experience, while approach #1 (preloading) is more memory-efficient and simple to implement for applications with large models.
- Both approaches benefit from disk caching, so model files are only downloaded once regardless of how many ModelManager instances you create.

## Core Concepts

### Components

#### Artifacts

Long-lived objects (models, embeddings, tokenizers) that are:

- Computed once and cached
- Automatically cleaned up when no longer needed
- Can have file dependencies and other artifacts as dependencies

#### Predictors

Functions that:

- Use artifacts as dependencies
- Are not cached themselves
- Can be called repeatedly with different inputs

### File Dependencies

Support for multiple file sources and caching strategies:

```python
@artifact
def load_embeddings(
    # Load from S3, keep on disk permanently
    embeddings: Annotated[
        Path,
        "s3://bucket/embeddings.npy",
        {"strategy": "on_disk"}
    ],
    # Load text file into memory as string
    vocab: Annotated[
        str,
        "gs://bucket/vocab.txt",
        {"strategy": "in_memory"}
    ]
):
    return {"embeddings": np.load(embeddings), "vocab": vocab.split()}
```

Available strategies:

- `on_disk` - Download and keep locally
- `on_disk_temporary` - Download temporarily
- `in_memory` - Load file contents into RAM
- `in_memory_stream` - Stream file contents via a generator

### Dependency Resolution

Components can depend on each other with clean syntax:

```python
@artifact
def tokenizer(vocab_file: Annotated[Path, "s3://bucket/vocab.txt"]):
    return Tokenizer.from_file(vocab_file)

@artifact
def embeddings(
    embedding_file: Annotated[Path, "s3://bucket/embeddings.npy"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer  # Automatically resolved
):
    # tokenizer is automatically loaded
    return Embeddings(embedding_file, tokenizer)

@predictor
def embed_text(
    text: str,
    embeddings=embeddings  # Automatically resolved
):
    return embeddings.embed(text)
```

### Namespace Management

```python
# Load components in different namespaces
with ModelManager([model_a], namespace="prod"):
    with ModelManager([model_b], namespace="staging"):
        # Use both without conflicts
        prod_result = predict_a("test")
        staging_result = predict_b("test")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Override default parameters
result = predict("input", model=load_model(model_path="local/path/model.pkl"))

# Or with ModelManager
with ModelManager({load_model: {"model_path": "local/path/model.pkl"}}):
    result = predict("input")  # Uses custom model path
```

### Generator-based Cleanup

```python
@artifact
def database_connection(url: str):
    conn = create_connection(url)
    try:
        yield conn  # Return the connection
    finally:
        conn.close()  # Automatically called during cleanup
```
