| `override_http_client_configuration` | `bool` | The value which determines to override properties of the passed Http Client from the sdk user |
| `http_call_back` | `HttpCallBack` | The callback value that is invoked before and after an HTTP call is made to an endpoint |
| `timeout` | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```python
client = ShellevClient(
    client_credentials_auth_credentials=ClientCredentialsAuthCredentials(
        o_auth_client_id='OAuthClientId',
        o_auth_client_secret='OAuthClientSecret'
    ),
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Environments

The SDK can be configured to use a different environment for making API calls. Available environments are:

### Fields

| Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |
| production | **Default** Production Server |
| environment2 | Test Server |
