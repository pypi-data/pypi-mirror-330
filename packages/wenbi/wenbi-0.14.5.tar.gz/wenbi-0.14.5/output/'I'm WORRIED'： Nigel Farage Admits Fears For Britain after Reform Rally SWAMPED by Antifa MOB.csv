0,00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840,"Well, J.D. Vance warned us the other week about freedom of speech."
1,00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.020,By that he meant censorship.
2,00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900,But there's another thing that happened last night
3,00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.340,that makes me worry about freedom of speech
4,00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.340,and about the whole democratic process.
5,00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.060,It was an event that I was doing in Camborne in Cornwall last night
6,00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.800,where a group called Antifa turned up.
7,00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.360,"Now, they have their origins in America"
8,00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.560,and they're more than happy to resort to violence.
9,00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.000,Have a quick look at some of the Antifa protesters from last night.
10,00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.120,Shame! Shame! Shame!
11,00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.000,Who protects the fascist?
12,00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.000,Who protects the fascist?
13,00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960,Shame on you! Shame on you!
14,00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.200,You should be f***ing embarrassed!
15,00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.660,Shame on you! Shame on you!
16,00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.540,"So let's be clear, these were masked protesters."
17,00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.120,Members of the public were expected to walk through them.
18,00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.040,"Of course, what they were looking for was members of the public to react."
19,00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080,One member of the public who was there had his tooth knocked out.
20,00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.940,But no arrests were made.
21,00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.600,And no attempt was made by Devon and Cornwall police
22,00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600,to separate protesters out.
23,00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.420,"And prior to the event,"
24,00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.560,"they'd made scores of phone calls to the venue saying,"
25,00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.140,cancel the event or there will be violence on your premises.
26,00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.900,I've got to tell you something.
27,00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740,I'm a great believer in political protest.
28,00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.060,"You can stand there and shout, maybe chuck the odd egg."
29,00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.600,All right?
30,00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.760,Just about live with that.
31,00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.860,"What I thought, I think what happened last night"
32,00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.240,was closer to political terrorism
33,00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.180,and quite extraordinary.
34,00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.200,"That Zoe Fox, Councillor Zoe Fox was there"
35,00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.440,and she was the Labour Mayor of Camborne up until last year.
36,00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.660,I have written to the Home Secretary
37,00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.640,and I will be actually writing to the Chief Constable
38,00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.840,of Devon and Cornwall Police
39,00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.320,complaining about their conduct.
40,00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.440,You've seen loads of political protests over the years.
41,00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.340,I just don't think people with masks
42,00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.360,should be able to crowd round the entrance.
43,00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.120,No.
44,00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.360,What is a democratic event?
45,00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.980,"Yeah, I completely agree."
46,00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.960,"I mean, actually you couldn't see it very well on that clip."
47,00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.180,No.
48,00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.420,The clip I looked at earlier where they were masked.
49,00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880,They look very intimidating.
50,00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.940,"Nobody should be intimidated in attending a political event,"
51,00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.080,a public event.
52,00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.460,"If the police and the organisers, reform presumably,"
53,00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.420,"have been in touch and liaised,"
54,00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.400,"as you would always have to do for this sort of thing,"
55,00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.180,how many people do you expect?
56,00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.280,"Have you got adequate car parking, etc., etc.?"
57,00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000,"But if the venue had had warnings of violence,"
58,00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.720,"I'm surprised that the police seem to think,"
59,00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.620,"well, perhaps they don't mean it."
60,00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.820,"Well, it's this response to policing,"
61,00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.540,"that we act when there's a problem,"
62,00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.700,rather than being preventative.
63,00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.380,And they could have just read online
64,00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.560,and have known what was going to happen.
65,00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.200,"Well, yes."
66,00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.180,"But I think there will have been people going to that,"
67,00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.080,"as there would be to any political party meeting,"
68,00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.300,"who might have gone,"
69,00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.060,"oh, I'm not going to go through that."
70,00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.800,"Well, 100 people who'd bought tickets turned around and left."
71,00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.720,"I'm not a member of your party, Nigel, obviously."
72,00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.860,"No, sure."
73,00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.660,I didn't expect you to be.
74,00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.680,OK.
75,00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.160,"But, you know, everybody has got the right to do that."
76,00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.720,And we're all used to it.
77,00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.260,"And, you know, I've been to a gazillion party conferences"
78,00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.740,"where they're noisy and, you know, not very pleasant,"
79,00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.500,but not that level of intimidation to members of the public.
80,00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.820,No.
81,00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.300,"In a village hall, I presume."
82,00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.740,This is a...
83,00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.840,"Well, it was a..."
84,00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.740,"In fact, it was a centre with a gymnasium,"
85,00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.580,a swimming pool.
86,00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.320,There were actually young kids coming in and out.
87,00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.000,So it's not...
88,00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.860,What I mean is it's not a purpose-built conference centre
89,00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.600,like you'd get at the Royal Labour or Torrid.
90,00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.660,No.
91,00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.560,"I mean, my concern here is that if these people are allowed"
92,00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.080,"to continue to behave like this,"
93,00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.000,and let's hope the Home Secretary does...
94,00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.220,"I mean, I think Antifa should be a banned organisation,"
95,00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.280,"frankly, because of the fact they've used violence so repeatedly,"
96,00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.600,particularly all over America.
97,00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.400,"But otherwise, how do we conduct elections?"
98,00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.560,How do we have proper debate?
99,00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.760,I think it's quite concerning.
100,00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.480,"We have, in this country, a serious..."
101,00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.760,And law enforcement have a serious blind spot
102,00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.300,when it comes to far-left extremism.
103,00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.140,"As you say, Antifa, particularly in the United States,"
104,00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.120,are a violent leftist extremist organisation.
105,00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.600,"The journalist Andy Ngo, who's a very good friend of mine,"
106,00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.280,actually tried to kill him for reporting on their activities.
107,00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.180,"So, you know, this is not something that we can tolerate"
108,00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.440,in the short term without it escalating in the long term.
109,00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.800,And we've seen this with other types of protests
110,00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.260,"over the last five years, that when you give them an inch,"
111,00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.800,it keeps going and going and going
112,00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.140,"until it's the destruction of property,"
113,00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.760,vandalism and eventually attacking people.
114,00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.340,And no arrests!
115,00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.400,No arrests!
116,00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.960,"And when you see the way that the police protest other protests,"
117,00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.240,"where they're so heavy-handed,"
118,00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.780,and this is straightforward democratic interference.
119,00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.000,"And what's remarkable is that, you know,"
120,00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.240,"for all of the talk in Parliament,"
121,00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.940,"particularly in the Labour Party,"
122,00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.400,"of how it's important for everybody to, you know,"
123,00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.560,"be nice to one another,"
124,00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.180,and they would be very quick to jump on incitement
125,00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.980,if it were from a right-wing party
126,00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.540,towards somebody in the Labour Party.
127,00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.860,But when an MP like Zahra Sultana is putting up posters of youth
128,00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.680,"that are really quite demonic-looking,"
129,00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.440,they have nothing to say about that.
130,00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.520,"And so, really, if the Labour Party,"
131,00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.160,you mentioned J.D. Vance's speech
132,00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.800,and him talking about how the greatest threat to us
133,00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.020,is the loss of our fundamental values in this country.
134,00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.860,"Well, diplomatically, in his relationship with Donald Trump,"
135,00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.900,"if Keir Starmer doesn't take things like this seriously,"
136,00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.460,"freedom of speech, the democratic process,"
137,00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.300,then that is not going to be very good
138,00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.100,for our relationship with America in the long term.
139,00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.500,No.
140,00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.500,"They are banning books in America, Emma."
141,00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.720,What are they banning?
142,00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.420,"They're banning books in libraries, aren't they?"
143,00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.820,Children's books.
144,00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.080,"Oh, they're taking some children's books out of public libraries."
145,00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.900,They're not banning them.
146,00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.340,They're not banning them.
147,00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.000,They're banning them from libraries.
148,00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.300,"They're not banning them or banning them,"
149,00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.120,but I know what you mean.
150,00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.200,"A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said,"
151,00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.000,police were aware of a political event
152,00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.560,at the Cambrai Leisure Centre in Paul Cornwall.
153,00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.720,Officers attended in order to ensure the safety of those present
154,00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.500,and prevent any potential breach of the peace.
155,00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.520,"Well, sorry."
156,00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.100,There were reports of minor issues that occurred
157,00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.380,between protesters and counter-protesters
158,00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.180,which were brought under control by officers.
159,00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.980,No arrests were made.
160,00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.460,What absolute cobblers.
161,00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.240,There were no counter-protesters.
162,00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.820,These were delegates coming to a conference
163,00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.040,who'd paid money to be there.
164,00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.060,"Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear."
165,00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.020,The What the Farage moment of the day is now
166,00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.060,Winston Churchill portraits are being removed
167,00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.920,from Parliament buildings.
168,00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.860,And that over the last couple of years
169,00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.060,"goes along with William Gladstone,"
170,00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.320,"Oliver Cromwell, Lord Liverpool,"
171,00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.760,"Jigga Wellington, William Wilberforce,"
172,00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.700,"Lord Salisbury, John Milton, Charles I,"
173,00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.920,and Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
174,00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.800,Do Labour hate our history that much?
175,00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.180,"26,000 works of art within the parliamentary estate"
176,00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.020,"that anybody can choose to have,"
177,00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.740,and many of them ring the changes.
178,00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.380,"I mean, I don't know what your office accommodation is like."
179,00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.760,Poor.
180,00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.200,OK.
181,00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.380,"Well, maybe we could have a tiny picture."
182,00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.580,We'll look for a Holbein.
183,00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.880,Yeah.
184,00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.300,"But, you know, they are constantly churned around."
185,00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.980,"Under the previous government, there was a review,"
186,00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.800,"I think it was 2022,"
187,00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.780,of the sort of works of art
188,00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.840,"that were being displayed in Parliament and public buildings,"
189,00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.120,because a lot of these are areas where the public go as well.
190,00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.440,Yeah.
191,00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.100,"Yeah, Port Colour's house particularly."
192,00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.760,"Yes, exactly."
193,00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.780,And Westminster Hall as well.
194,00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.860,"And, you know, so there was a review,"
195,00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.340,"an audit, I think they called it,"
196,00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.060,"of people or symbols, if you like, of slavery"
197,00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.820,or things that we might not be comfortable with anymore.
198,00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.140,Yeah. Wow.
199,00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.920,"But I think to the idea that, you know,"
200,00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.360,they've taken down Churchill
201,00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.400,"and they've put him in a bunker somewhere,"
202,00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.340,they're just changing things around.
203,00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.740,"Well, there is."
204,00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.560,"I mean, it's rather,"
205,00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.260,"it's sort of Diane Abbott in and Churchill out, really, isn't it?"
206,00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.100,Or am I being unfair?
207,00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.220,You're not being unfair.
208,00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.780,"I mean, it's not arbitrary either."
209,00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.080,The portraits that they've been removing
210,00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.860,are portraits that were on that list.
211,00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.500,And many of them were included on that list
212,00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.460,"for, you know, their links to slavery"
213,00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.560,"for very tenuous reasons,"
214,00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.560,"including, for some reason,"
215,00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.500,"William Wilberforce,"
216,00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.100,who spearheaded the abolition of slavery.
217,00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.360,Bizarre.
218,00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.280,And the thing about Churchill is actually
219,00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.300,"that this is coming from a politically motivated,"
220,00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.620,ideologically motivated campaign
221,00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.500,of defamation against a national hero.
222,00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.700,One of the main things
223,00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.900,that often gets brought up against him
224,00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.820,"is the Bengal famine,"
225,00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.140,which has been repeatedly
226,00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.740,myth-busted
227,00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.920,and shown to be completely factually false
228,00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.340,"by some of our most eminent historians,"
229,00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.740,"including Churchill's biographer,"
230,00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.460,Andrew Roberts.
231,00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.820,So I think what we're seeing
232,00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.420,with the removal of these portraits
233,00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.060,is very much in line with what we saw
234,00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.040,during the campaign.
235,00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.060,It's a trend.
236,00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.700,How funny.
237,00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.620,There is a large statue of Churchill.
238,00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.060,There is.
239,00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.940,There is for now.
240,00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.840,Which keeps getting graffiti.
241,00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.280,For now.
242,00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:39.600,And attacked.
243,00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.580,"Well, it's Churchill out in Parliament,"
244,00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.420,but Churchill into the Oval Office.
245,00:08:43.420 --> 00:09:12.960,"So,"
