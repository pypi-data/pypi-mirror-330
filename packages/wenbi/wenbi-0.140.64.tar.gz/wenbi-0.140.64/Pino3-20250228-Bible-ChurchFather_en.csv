0,00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200,"Yes, thank you very much, Jason, for having me."
1,00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.560,This is my third time speaking to your audience in China.
2,00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.340,And I also will say that this is the third time you have not brought me to Beijing to give this talk in person.
3,00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.080,So I forgive you for that.
4,00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.280,But hopefully the next time we can do it in person.
5,00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.200,So the title of my talk for today is The Scriptures and the Church Fathers.
6,00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.540,Another title that we could give to this conversation today could be According to the Scriptures.
7,00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.000,According to the Scriptures.
8,00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.280,This is a phrase from the creed that we say in church every Sunday and every morning in our morning prayers.
9,00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:54.640,"So the phrase According to the Scriptures is something that's professed by Orthodox Christians, by Christians that profess an apostolic faith that belonged to a historical apostolic church."
10,00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.540,And it's a kind of dogmatic theological profession about the scriptures.
11,00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.740,And it's one of the only dogmatic statements that we make about the scriptures.
12,00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.500,"So if you think about the creed, we profess, I believe in one God, the Father Almighty."
13,00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.560,And we go through this litany of Trinitarian theology.
14,00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.800,We talk about the Father.
15,00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.120,We talk about the Son.
16,00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.580,We talk about the Holy Spirit.
17,00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.560,What the Son has done in his incarnation by becoming a human being.
18,00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.840,But there's only one mention of the scriptures.
19,00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.020,And that's the phrase According to the Scriptures.
20,00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.740,"So specifically, we say that we talk about the Savior."
21,00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.340,"And we say that he was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried."
22,00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.320,"And on the third day, he rose again according to the scriptures."
23,00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:52.680,"So immediately, the faith in Jesus Christ is contextualized by a belief about scripture."
24,00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.000,"So one of the first questions we want to ask is, when we say scriptures in the creed, is this the same as the Bible?"
25,00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.280,Most of you have seen a Bible.
26,00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.520,You probably own one.
27,00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.740,What is the relationship between the Bible and the scriptures?
28,00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.960,"So when I say a Bible, you probably have an image in your mind."
29,00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.860,"The cultures that we live in, our modern society, understands the Bible."
30,00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:27.820,"Because there is a network of, especially Protestant Christians who have gone around the world, translating the Bible into multiple languages."
31,00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.500,"And so we get a kind of visceral, visual image of what a Bible is."
32,00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:43.800,"And I assume this is true in China, as well as in the United States and in Europe, that we have this association with the Bible, with this physical artifact, this physical object."
33,00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.000,So we actually have this tradition in the United States where they used to put Bibles in every hotel room.
34,00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.980,"So if you went on vacation, you went to stay in a hotel, every room that you stayed in would have a Bible in the drawer."
35,00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.260,"And so my kids, when we would go on trips, the first thing my kids do is look in the drawer in the hotel to see if it has a Bible."
36,00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.800,"If it has a Bible, they say, this is a good hotel."
37,00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.540,"And if it doesn't have a Bible, they say, this is a bad hotel."
38,00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.200,So this is the Bible that we talk about.
39,00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.060,That's the physical object.
40,00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:23.340,"But when we talk about the scriptures, the word scripture comes from the Latin word for writing, which corresponds to the Greek word for scripture."
41,00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:32.360,"But when we're talking about scripture, we're not talking about the physical object, but the message and the communication that is conveyed inside."
42,00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.360,"So you can draw an analogy with a letter, especially a love letter."
43,00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:53.840,"If you write to your loved one, to your spouse or somebody you'd like to marry, and you write a message of love, especially if you're in a difficult situation, if you're separated by long distances, if you fear for your life."
44,00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:08.600,"If people, soldiers at war, for example, might write a letter of love to their spouse, we can distinguish between the message that's inside of the written letter and the physical object itself."
45,00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600,So it's the message inside that's important.
46,00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.700,"But it's also the message, the communication that's conveyed there that's meaningful."
47,00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:33.960,"And so this is the reason that in the Orthodox Church and in the Byzantine tradition, but in other ancient traditions, you see this effort and this labor to present the scriptures in a way that conveys how sacred they are."
48,00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.660,So they might be conveyed in a gold cover or silver cover with jewels.
49,00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:51.900,Scribes will work to illuminate the scriptures in such a way that they convey the majesty and the beauty of what is conveyed inside.
50,00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:05.280,"So in the Orthodox tradition, the scriptures are vested like a priest, like the temple itself, in order to convey the sacred character of the scriptures."
51,00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.400,"It's not something, you know, just a cheap book that we throw on the chair and we throw on our desk or on the floor."
52,00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.160,It's meant to convey what's inside.
53,00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:32.680,"So and this this idea that the outside tells us something about what's inside is very important when approaching the scriptures, because the scriptures themselves are an external communication of something that is deeper."
54,00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.680,So it's it's very significant.
55,00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.140,So it's it's very significant.
56,00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.420,And perhaps you don't take it for granted in Chinese culture.
57,00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:48.700,"You'll have to tell me maybe when we have when we discuss, you can tell me the some of the differences between Chinese culture and stereotypical Eastern cultures."
58,00:05:48.700 --> 00:06:03.720,"But it is significant that God chooses to to send this message to communicate with humankind that he has created with words in a written message, but in in terms of words."
59,00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:19.300,"So even even when you simply hear the scriptures, so if you're not if you don't have the physical artifact, but you're simply hearing the scripture, there is spoken communication in human language and language is the mode of the revelation."
60,00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.580,"Yeah, right."
61,00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.260,But this and this is what language does.
62,00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:31.940,So we tend to think of of intelligence and rationality in terms in terms that are applicable to to animals in general.
63,00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:42.340,"So we talk about intelligence, for example, in scientific community, we might talk about intelligence as the ability to use tools, the ability to solve problems."
64,00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:51.560,"But when we look at what language is for a human being, it's not simply about an intelligence that can be replicated by an animal or by a computer."
65,00:06:51.560 --> 00:07:00.680,It's something that takes what would seem to have no existence for a purely physical creature.
66,00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.980,And it gives it physical being.
67,00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:12.600,And so this access that language gives us to an invisible world is what we what we refer to as the spiritual world.
68,00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.980,Language is what what gives form outward form to a spiritual reality.
69,00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.600,"And this is the basic meaning behind the word like logos, which is a word."
70,00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.000,But it's also a communication meaning.
71,00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:39.160,"It's it's it's not simply animal forms of intelligence, but it is it's access to a spiritual reality, which ultimately means the world in which God exists."
72,00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.660,"The world in which the angels exist, the kingdom of heaven exists is beyond."
73,00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.840,It lies beyond the physical senses.
74,00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.180,And we have mind.
75,00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.120,The human mind is able to access this reality.
76,00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:02.180,"So when we look at when we look at the Bible, when we look at scripture, we should think of it as more than simply a communication of information."
77,00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.860,"Language can be code like computer code, which conveys information."
78,00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:16.320,But the way that we look at the language of scripture is as a form of creation and as a form of incarnation.
79,00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.480,And this means that the the relationship goes the other way as well.
80,00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:35.600,"So creation itself, the world that God creates from the beginning, when he creates matter, material things, the mountains and the skies and all the animals is also a form of language."
81,00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.480,And it's a form of communication and an encoding of of meaning.
82,00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.920,Maybe I'll stop here so you can translate.
83,00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.300,Let me.
84,00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.200,I need to.
85,00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.340,Yeah.
86,00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.440,Yeah.
87,00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.720,I'll let it again.
88,00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.320,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
89,00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:59.180,"So when we're thinking about when we're thinking about the Bible and we're thinking about scripture, it's not simply information that goes from from point A to point B."
90,00:08:59.620 --> 00:08:59.860,OK.
91,00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:09.680,"But it is a manifestation or a visualization, as we've been saying, that you could call a materialization or an incarnation."
92,00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.800,"So the fathers of the church, the saints of the church talk about this."
93,00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:31.320,"We obviously have the book of scripture, but the fathers also talk about the creation itself, the world that God has made as a book, as something that conveys the same meaning and the same revelation of God, the same communication."
94,00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:40.180,"So when I look at the mountains, when I look at the sky, the sun, the beauty of the created world, this is also God speaking."
95,00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.760,"So just just like you might have a letter from someone you love, which which is a communication from that person."
96,00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.640,You might also have an object that your child has made.
97,00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.220,"For example, my daughter made these little plants."
98,00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.580,She knits them.
99,00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:09.460,"And this object is not just a physical object, but for you, this communicates the presence of your child, the love of your child and your relationship with that with that person."
100,00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.080,I'll show you the text.
101,00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.240,"So for the fathers, there's there are these two books."
102,00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.460,There's the book of scripture with with literal words.
103,00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:27.280,"And then there's the book of creation with the which is the words of God expressing himself visibly, tangibly."
104,00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:39.560,"So if if scripture is a book and just like nature is a book, birds, rocks, the smaller animals, these these they both need to be read."
105,00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.460,Right.
106,00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:46.660,"We need to see beyond the message, beyond the physical, the outward covering and move in."
107,00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.360,"So animals, for example, interact with the same world that we interact with."
108,00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.100,"A computer would interact with a camera, for example, sees the same world that we see."
109,00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:08.900,"But what what we have uniquely, the human mind has the ability to read these things, not just read the scriptures and derive meaning, but also read the creation and look at the world and see the meaning there."
110,00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:24.560,"And so the technical word in Orthodox theology and Christian theology for this this process of reading, of accessing the deeper meaning, the spiritual reality or the invisible reality is theoria."
111,00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.020,"We have this word theoria, which means literally means vision."
112,00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.000,But it's the vision that penetrates beyond the surface.
113,00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.760,It's to see what is inside.
114,00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:40.120,"So theoria can be translated as contemplation, but we're using it in the concept in the context of interpretation."
115,00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:54.460,"So, again, this is understanding the meaning that the spiritual reality within it means that when that two people could be looking at the same thing, but one person sees the purpose and they understand all the deeper connections and the message that this is communicating."
116,00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.000,"And the other person might not, even if you know everything about what you're looking at."
117,00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:07.260,"So if I give you a scientific breakdown of this object that my daughter made, I can tell you all about it, but I might not understand what it means."
118,00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:19.940,"And so if theoria is the word for for seeing into something, being able to perceive the depth of something, the content that's within the Greek word for this would be, again, logos."
119,00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:28.860,"And this means that when we speak about logos, and again, this is word in English, we're talking about God's revelation."
120,00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.180,"So God reveals himself not by bringing something out, but by allowing us to see in."
121,00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:41.140,"Another way of thinking about this is that in order to reveal himself, God has to clothe himself."
122,00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.120,He has to put something on the outside for us to be able to penetrate that.
123,00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.520,So God clothes himself or his communication in the physical world.
124,00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.500,"He clothes himself in words, in human language, in the book of scripture."
125,00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.340,"But then he clothes himself in the flesh, in human flesh, in the incarnation of Jesus Christ."
126,00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:14.700,"So all of these realities have a logos, a principle or a reason, a meaning that is beneath the surface."
127,00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.500,Creation has a logos.
128,00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.440,The scriptures have a meaning.
129,00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:27.220,"And of course, inside the flesh of Jesus Christ is the logos, who is the son of God, one of the trinity."
130,00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.600,"And so we speak of the Lord Jesus Christ as the logos, as the word."
131,00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.220,And we speak of the scriptures as the word of God.
132,00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:39.660,"So hopefully, this helps contextualize what we mean by the message of scripture."
133,00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:47.020,Sometimes we tend to think of written communication in a very one-dimensional way as a communication of meaning or information.
134,00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.060,"But when we're talking about the meaning of scripture and the communication of the revelation of God in scripture,"
135,00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.080,"we're talking about something of a different order, something spiritual."
136,00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:07.580,"So when the fathers, the church fathers, the saints approach the scriptures, one of the results of this understanding of what scripture is,"
137,00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.780,is that the scriptures become inexhaustible.
138,00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.580,The depth of meaning never ends.
139,00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.900,"Once you go inside, there's no end to how deep you can go."
140,00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.800,"And so we've talked about the person of Jesus Christ, the person of the logos,"
141,00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.600,"but there's another person of the trinity we talk about in this context,"
142,00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.040,"in the context of the meaning of scripture and the depth of scripture,"
143,00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.560,and that's the person of the Holy Spirit.
144,00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:35.360,"So if the invisible reality of the scriptures, the meaning of the scriptures,"
145,00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.640,"are like an ocean, a bottomless ocean with depth,"
146,00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.520,"then the Holy Spirit, according to St. Paul,"
147,00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.560,"is the one who searches the deep things of the scripture, of the spirit, of God."
148,00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.500,"So Jesus says in the New Testament to search the scriptures, right?"
149,00:14:52.980 --> 00:15:00.020,Scriptures is this infinite meaning into which we can search and go deeper and deeper.
150,00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.780,"So one of the dangers, I would say, for us,"
151,00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.200,"especially when we live in this age of information,"
152,00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.420,"where everything is easy to access,"
153,00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.940,"not only because there are printed Bibles,"
154,00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.240,"but because we have computers and phones where it's easy to access information,"
155,00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:23.280,"one of the dangers is that we don't go deeper into these scriptures,"
156,00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.420,and we sort of remain at the surface.
157,00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.660,"Even if we are very knowledgeable about the scriptures,"
158,00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.600,"even if we have memorized the scriptures,"
159,00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.820,"and a lot of Western Christians do this,"
160,00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.180,we may not be doing this process of searching the depths.
161,00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.040,"And so we have to be careful about this,"
162,00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.000,because the scriptures can seem very simple.
163,00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.840,It's like the surface of the water.
164,00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.280,It's kind of one-dimensional.
165,00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:55.060,"But we have to realize that it goes much, much further than this."
166,00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:00.340,"Yeah, so again, our problem basically,"
167,00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.940,"very simply, is that we stay on the surface."
168,00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.160,So we can learn all the details about what is happening in the scripture.
169,00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.300,We might know the story of Genesis.
170,00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.860,"We might know the story of Noah and Abraham,"
171,00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.840,"and the prophets, and the Babylonian exile."
172,00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.340,"And we might know the gospels,"
173,00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.780,"but we don't understand what the deeper meaning,"
174,00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.600,the spiritual meaning of these texts is.
175,00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.080,And one of the measures of whether we are understanding the scriptures in a deeper way
176,00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.980,is whether our interpretation of the scriptures
177,00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.700,"are taking us beyond the stories themselves,"
178,00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.100,"and the histories themselves,"
179,00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.360,but also the world that we live in.
180,00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.100,"So one of the things we see today is a very secular Christianity,"
181,00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:58.180,"where we're not able to look beyond the political situation that we live in,"
182,00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.800,the social situation that we live in.
183,00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.140,And sometimes this could manifest itself in good things.
184,00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.480,"For example, if we're serving our neighbor,"
185,00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.200,"if we're having healthy communities,"
186,00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.220,"if we have a good church community,"
187,00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.880,these can be good things.
188,00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.780,But they might also be superficial.
189,00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.180,"And so when we talk about the superficial reading of scripture,"
190,00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.960,we're not talking about bad things.
191,00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.000,"We're talking about something that is just the beginning,"
192,00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.100,the entry point.
193,00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.300,And so the idea of going beyond these things
194,00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.240,"is not that these things are bad,"
195,00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.840,"and we need to stop serving the poor,"
196,00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.860,"we need to stop having a good parish community,"
197,00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.980,and we need to stop fasting or something like this.
198,00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.660,"The idea is that these are the beginning,"
199,00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.580,"and these things are supposed to take us to a next step and a next step,"
200,00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.140,because we long as human beings for eternity.
201,00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.580,We long for the invisible world of the kingdom of God.
202,00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.520,And so we need to go beyond these things.
203,00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.020,And this is what the church fathers and their writings allow us to do.
204,00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.640,So the writings of the church fathers are a form of theoria.
205,00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.280,It's a form of contemplation of scripture that opens up the treasures of scripture
206,00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.860,and allows us to look within and to go deeper.
207,00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.040,And so we have the writings of the church fathers.
208,00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.100,They have written commentaries on the Bible.
209,00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.820,They have written sermons that they preached in church to unfold the scriptures.
210,00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.780,But they have also written hymns that we sing in order to unfold the scriptures.
211,00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.260,"And so to give you an example of different readings of scripture,"
212,00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.080,"when we look at the book of Genesis,"
213,00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.280,"the book of Genesis talks about the creation of the world,"
214,00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.120,"but it will also bring us through the story of Noah,"
215,00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.620,"the story of Abraham, which are stories of redemption,"
216,00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.920,which are stories of salvation.
217,00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.020,"And so if we have a superficial or literal interpretation,"
218,00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.000,we stop at the stories themselves.
219,00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.000,"So we might be very focused, for example, on how God created the world."
220,00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.360,"And so we might get into a debate about,"
221,00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.060,is evolution scientifically accurate?
222,00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.500,Did God create biological theory?
223,00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.860,"Or did God create the world in six days,"
224,00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.020,"literal six days, as opposed to millions and billions of years?"
225,00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.120,And we're not able to go beyond these details.
226,00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.400,"So again, these things are not necessarily bad,"
227,00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.120,but they're just one level.
228,00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.460,"And it may be the first level,"
229,00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.460,"the lowest level of understanding the scripture,"
230,00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.260,if we're concerned with the physical details of how God created.
231,00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.460,"To give you, I'll let you translate that."
232,00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.740,"So another example from the book of Genesis,"
233,00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.120,"if we have the story of Abraham,"
234,00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.600,"for the Jewish people,"
235,00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.220,the stories of Abraham are about their ancestors.
236,00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.680,It's about their family line.
237,00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.480,"For a Christian,"
238,00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.460,"for whom we are not necessarily physical descendants of Abraham,"
239,00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.180,"the stories of Abraham and his sons,"
240,00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.480,"and his son Isaac,"
241,00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.620,"and his sons Jacob,"
242,00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.060,"these are stories about our spiritual,"
243,00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.480,"our spiritual story,"
244,00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.580,our spiritual heritage.
245,00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.140,"In the book of Exodus,"
246,00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.540,we have the story of Moses
247,00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.960,escaping Egypt
248,00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.360,"and freeing the Israelites from Egypt,"
249,00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.780,"from the hand of Pharaoh,"
250,00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.540,who's a tyrant.
251,00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.380,"And this is,"
252,00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.620,"again,"
253,00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.680,"this is for the Jewish people,"
254,00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760,"this is their history,"
255,00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:24.460,right?
256,00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.240,"This is,"
257,00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.300,"a Jewish person reads this,"
258,00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.000,"they can say,"
259,00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.600,this is how our ancestors suffered.
260,00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.380,"This is,"
261,00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.780,these are the things that God did for our ancestors.
262,00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.180,"When we read the scripture,"
263,00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.480,"when we read the book of Exodus as Christians,"
264,00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.880,"who are not ethnically Jewish,"
265,00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.600,we see the spiritual redemption of our souls
266,00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.680,"from the tyrant,"
267,00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:46.500,the devil.
268,00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.520,We see the person of Christ
269,00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.720,who frees us from this spiritual bondage.
270,00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.760,"Not because,"
271,00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.880,"not because it didn't happen for real,"
272,00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.280,not because there wasn't a real Egyptian Pharaoh
273,00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.780,"or the Jews didn't really leave Egypt,"
274,00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.960,but because there's another deeper spiritual dimension
275,00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.720,to these stories.
276,00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.120,And so the way we usually talk about
277,00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.260,"these two approaches to scripture,"
278,00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.920,one that we could call more superficial
279,00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.340,"and one that's deeper,"
280,00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.080,is the difference between literal
281,00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.120,and spiritual interpretation.
282,00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.660,Literal and spiritual.
283,00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.800,"And the word literal,"
284,00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.680,"at least in English,"
285,00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.600,"is related to,"
286,00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.340,"it comes from the Latin word for litera,"
287,00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.260,which means letter.
288,00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.120,"And so it's talking about the actual text,"
289,00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.480,the actual words that are spoken.
290,00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.380,"So for example,"
291,00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.480,the story of paradise in Genesis
292,00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.260,"talks about a garden,"
293,00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.420,"a physical garden with a physical tree,"
294,00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.420,and it's a physical space.
295,00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.880,This is the literal interpretation of the text.
296,00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.000,And so the spiritual interpretation
297,00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.860,begins from the literal.
298,00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.080,"It doesn't abandon the literal interpretation,"
299,00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.440,but it begins with the literal
300,00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.420,and it goes deeper.
301,00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:56.960,"And so for example,"
302,00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.020,"with the tree and the garden in Genesis,"
303,00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.400,"the garden of paradise,"
304,00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.440,we look at the spiritual reality
305,00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.080,of the knowledge of God
306,00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.060,and the invisible kingdom of heaven
307,00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.980,in which our minds and our souls
308,00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.200,can participate beyond the physical.
309,00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.880,"So when we talk about literal versus spiritual,"
310,00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.940,we're not saying that the literal doesn't exist.
311,00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.960,"We're saying that the literal is just the beginning,"
312,00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.140,"it's just the surface level,"
313,00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.120,and the spiritual goes beyond it.
314,00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.560,"And again,"
315,00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.580,the image is that of outward clothing.
316,00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.460,"So if the logos,"
317,00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.080,"if the word clothes himself in flesh,"
318,00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.060,that means that he really does have a human body.
319,00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:36.980,"The word,"
320,00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.520,the son of God really does take on a human body.
321,00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.400,"And this human body reveals him to us,"
322,00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.900,but there's also something beyond the human body.
323,00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.440,He's not just a human being.
324,00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.620,He's not just physical.
325,00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.360,"So the physical allows us to see what's inside,"
326,00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.420,but we have to go beyond it.
327,00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.900,And so it actually becomes sinful or problematic
328,00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.500,"to stay at the surface,"
329,00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.980,"not to acknowledge the surface,"
330,00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.360,but to stay there.
331,00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.280,"So with Christ, for example,"
332,00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.640,"we have to acknowledge that he's real flesh and blood,"
333,00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.960,"but we can't,"
334,00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.740,we can't stop there and say that he's just a human being.
335,00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.240,"This would be,"
336,00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.100,this would be wrong.
337,00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.040,And this is true of the scripture as well.
338,00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.640,"The scripture is written,"
339,00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.700,"written in the form of stories that are,"
340,00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.320,"that are real things that actually happened,"
341,00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.980,"but we can't stop at the surface of,"
342,00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.680,of the actual story and the physical realities.
343,00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.500,"And this is,"
344,00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.400,this is really the mystery of being a human being is that we live in a
345,00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.260,"spiritual world,"
346,00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.600,but we access it through the physical world.
347,00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.340,"And so another,"
348,00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.280,"another word for this,"
349,00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.180,"we've used the word theoria for this,"
350,00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.400,"for this idea of seeing,"
351,00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.260,"but another word that describes this,"
352,00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.380,this phenomenon is the word mystical.
353,00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:54.820,"Mist,"
354,00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.280,the word mystical or mystery.
355,00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:56.700,"And you,"
356,00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.700,"you might've heard this explanation,"
357,00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.020,"this etymology before,"
358,00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.720,"that the word mystery comes from the Greek word for closing your eyes,"
359,00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.060,the verb for to close your eyes.
360,00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.100,"So something is mystical very specifically when,"
361,00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.200,"when there is something that cannot be seen,"
362,00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.780,"but you,"
363,00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.380,"but you are accessing it or seeing it never in spite of,"
364,00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.400,or through the physical reality.
365,00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.200,"So I'll give you a very,"
366,00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.340,"a very simple example,"
367,00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.380,"the mystery of Holy communion,"
368,00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.960,the mystery of Christ's body and blood.
369,00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.620,I don't see blood.
370,00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.540,I don't see a physical body.
371,00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.480,What I see is wine.
372,00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.980,"What I see is baked bread,"
373,00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.000,but invisibly beyond this is the body and blood of Christ.
374,00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.360,"This is,"
375,00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.400,this is what a mystery is.
376,00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.160,"And so this is,"
377,00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.520,this is the reality with all the sacraments of the church.
378,00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.260,We talk about the mysteries of the church.
379,00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.280,"There's an invisible reality that I have to understand and see with my faith,"
380,00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.140,"but it is communicated or experienced,"
381,00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.280,through something physical.
382,00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.680,This is reality of baptism.
383,00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.460,This is a reality of confession of ordination.
384,00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.300,Something invisible is happening inside of this physical outward reality.
385,00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.080,"And so this is,"
386,00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.240,this is what's happening with the literal and the spiritual interpretation of
387,00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:13.460,scripture.
388,00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.620,It's a mystical interpretation.
389,00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.060,"We take something that seems very simple on the outside,"
390,00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.380,"but with the eyes of faith,"
391,00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.720,we're able to see deeper.
392,00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.740,"And so obviously,"
393,00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.800,"you know,"
394,00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.300,"we don't have,"
395,00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.260,we don't have the time here to go into the details of all the different
396,00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.420,spiritual interpretations of scripture.
397,00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.840,"But we,"
398,00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.680,"what we can say is that this is the basic structure of,"
399,00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.580,of Christian spirituality.
400,00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.600,"God clothes himself in what is physical,"
401,00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.820,what is visible and outward.
402,00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.860,And in order to reveal something that is inherently invisible and spiritual.
403,00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:56.340,And so all Christian life is trying to access what is spiritual.
404,00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.340,"And so this is,"
405,00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.260,this is the patristic or the orthodox approach to scripture as well.
406,00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:06.940,And the church tries to convey to us the deeper reality.
407,00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.480,This is why we have gold covers for the gospel.
408,00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.340,"This is why we,"
409,00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.460,we process the gospel during the services.
410,00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.200,"We kiss the gospel in order to,"
411,00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.160,"to convey that,"
412,00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.040,that deeper reality of the deeper approach to scripture.
413,00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.020,"And so sometimes,"
414,00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:23.320,"you know,"
415,00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:23.780,"people will,"
416,00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:29.900,will talk as if Protestants are very devoted to the Bible and maybe Catholics
417,00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.820,and Orthodox are devoted to other things.
418,00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.320,"They're more devoted to tradition or liturgical worship or icons,"
419,00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.620,"but it's not the reality of the,"
420,00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.320,of the approach of the church fathers is that the scriptures are central because
421,00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.360,the scriptures are one of the forms in which God incarnates himself and
422,00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.800,communicates himself to us.
423,00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.440,"So there's,"
424,00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.100,so St.
425,00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.180,"Photios the Great,"
426,00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.800,"the ninth century patriarch of Constantinople,"
427,00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.040,Phocis.
428,00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.100,"He,"
429,00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.800,"he speaks about the scriptures as,"
430,00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.360,something that is the duty of every Orthodox Christian to study in order to be
431,00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:04.820,prepared.
432,00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.180,"The Lord said in the,"
433,00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.060,"in the new Testament,"
434,00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.820,"you know,"
435,00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.320,"do not think,"
436,00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:16.880,do not plan in advance what you will say when they bring you before your
437,00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.620,persecutors.
438,00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.340,"And the,"
439,00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.260,and St.
440,00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:19.640,"Peter,"
441,00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.960,"in one of his epistles says,"
442,00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.700,be prepared always to give an account for the hope that is in you.
443,00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.040,And St.
444,00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.560,"Phocis,"
445,00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.460,"the patriarch says,"
446,00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.880,this means that we should be studying the scriptures so that when we have to
447,00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.280,"give an account of ourselves,"
448,00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.180,"of our faith,"
449,00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.180,we are prepared.
450,00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.820,"We need to know the scriptures as Orthodox Christians,"
451,00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.620,"even though on,"
452,00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.380,"when the time comes,"
453,00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.520,it is the Holy spirit himself.
454,00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.340,It is God himself who will speak through us.
455,00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.100,"So I'll,"
456,00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.540,I'll stop there and maybe we can take some questions and discuss these things
457,00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:54.820,further.
458,00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.120,If people need clarification.
459,00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:56.700,Yeah.
460,00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.860,"So the terms univocal,"
461,00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.280,"equivocal and analogical,"
462,00:27:59.340 --> 00:27:59.760,"these are,"
463,00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.800,"these are scholastic terms and they're probably,"
464,00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:09.880,so univocal basically means that there's a one-to-one correspondence between our
465,00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.260,language or our words and God himself.
466,00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.800,"So when we say God is a being,"
467,00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.440,"for example,"
468,00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.120,"are we talking about God being a being the way we are a being,"
469,00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.240,"or is there,"
470,00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:21.880,"is there some,"
471,00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.340,"does,"
472,00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.360,"does the word change when we're talking about,"
473,00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.460,"when we're talking about God,"
474,00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.260,"if the word changes,"
475,00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.600,that's an equivocation.
476,00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.580,"Um,"
477,00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:29.560,"and,"
478,00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.060,"uh,"
479,00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.840,"analogical would be the word changes,"
480,00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.660,"but not in a way that is,"
481,00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.880,that is false.
482,00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.680,"So for example,"
483,00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.660,"um,"
484,00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.920,"an equivocation would be to say that,"
485,00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.860,"um,"
486,00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.140,"you know,"
487,00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:42.620,"uh,"
488,00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.020,"trying to think of an example,"
489,00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.200,it's not too vulgar.
490,00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.280,"Um,"
491,00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:46.660,"we,"
492,00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.400,we all have words.
493,00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.300,"I'm sure you have these,"
494,00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.080,"you have words in Chinese where the word,"
495,00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:50.560,"you know,"
496,00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.220,"the meaning can,"
497,00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.040,can change.
498,00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.620,"And if you're not careful,"
499,00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.740,you're not careful.
500,00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.580,You're using the word in two completely different ways.
501,00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.120,"This is an,"
502,00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.440,this is an equivocation.
503,00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.520,"Analogy is where the word,"
504,00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.180,"uh,"
505,00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.700,"changes,"
506,00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.640,but not because it's a different use of the word.
507,00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:08.520,"Uh,"
508,00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.380,"but for example,"
509,00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.220,"this is the classic case of,"
510,00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:11.960,of Aristotle.
511,00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.700,"He says that,"
512,00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.500,"uh,"
513,00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.180,"you know,"
514,00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.280,I can be healthy and certain foods can be healthy.
515,00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.180,Right.
516,00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:18.840,"If I say that,"
517,00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.440,"if I say that broccoli is healthy,"
518,00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.620,it's healthy food.
519,00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.060,"I'm not saying that broccoli is healthy the way that I'm healthy,"
520,00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.420,"but it's,"
521,00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:26.940,"this,"
522,00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.880,it's an analogy.
523,00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.940,"It's analogous because it's the,"
524,00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:30.420,"the,"
525,00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.100,"my health is related to the healthiness of the,"
526,00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.780,of the broccoli.
527,00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.420,If I'm eating.
528,00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.060,I'm safe.
529,00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.580,I'm safe.
530,00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:35.860,Yeah.
531,00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.260,So very much more simply.
532,00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.040,"So avoiding,"
533,00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.740,"avoiding the,"
534,00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.060,"these complicated scholastic conversations,"
535,00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.060,"uh,"
536,00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.440,"there are principles that we,"
537,00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.580,that we have when we read the scriptures.
538,00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.980,And one of them is that we know that God is not physical.
539,00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.340,So physical descriptions of God are going to be metaphorical.
540,00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:52.660,"And,"
541,00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:52.940,"you know,"
542,00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.880,"we're taught this by the scripture itself,"
543,00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.080,"that God doesn't have a body,"
544,00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.600,that God is not a mortal.
545,00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.440,"Like we are,"
546,00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.060,he's not divisible.
547,00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.760,"Like we are,"
548,00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.140,"you know,"
549,00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.560,"we kind of fall apart and God,"
550,00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.580,God doesn't.
551,00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.320,"Um,"
552,00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.060,so we're taught things in scripture.
553,00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.460,"And so we,"
554,00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.500,"when we read the scripture,"
555,00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.460,"we have to read,"
556,00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.420,"um,"
557,00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.280,"in a way that is consistent and where the,"
558,00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:12.900,"where the,"
559,00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.440,"the,"
560,00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.800,"the details about God,"
561,00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.900,"the descriptions of God make sense with the whole of what we know about,"
562,00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:20.760,"about God,"
563,00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.840,"not to narrowly,"
564,00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.980,"narrowly confine our reading to,"
565,00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.720,to one or two descriptions.
566,00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.120,Yeah.
567,00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.440,"And very,"
568,00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.380,"very quickly to,"
569,00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.560,"to address the,"
570,00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:29.920,"the,"
571,00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.220,"the,"
572,00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.740,"the main part of the question,"
573,00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:32.960,"the,"
574,00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.360,"we,"
575,00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:33.760,"the,"
576,00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.160,"the term essence of God,"
577,00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:35.800,"the essence,"
578,00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.480,"uh,"
579,00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.780,"technically speaking is,"
580,00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.300,"uh,"
581,00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.880,specifically the word for what we don't know about God.
582,00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.060,"It,"
583,00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:42.300,"it,"
584,00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.640,"it gives us language for saying in what way we don't understand God,"
585,00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.580,"because God,"
586,00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.200,"like we said,"
587,00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.720,is an infinite depth.
588,00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.340,"So our mind can't reach that far,"
589,00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.140,"but we,"
590,00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.940,"we have to,"
591,00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.940,we have to be clear and profess that God does make himself known.
592,00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.240,"So we do,"
593,00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.760,"we do know God through his,"
594,00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:02.180,"uh,"
595,00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:02.580,"and we know,"
596,00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.260,"we know things that are true about God,"
597,00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.220,"even if we don't,"
598,00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.600,we can't comprehend or define what God is.
599,00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:08.920,Yeah.
600,00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.240,Yeah.
601,00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:09.920,"So the,"
602,00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.480,"the idea,"
603,00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.180,"uh,"
604,00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.820,"flesh and clothing are both are two different,"
605,00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.100,are two related images for the same thing.
606,00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.480,"So when we say,"
607,00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.620,"when we say clothing,"
608,00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.020,"we're,"
609,00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.600,"we're talking about the same phenomenon with,"
610,00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.040,"uh,"
611,00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.560,the flesh of Christ.
612,00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.800,"So you could talk about the,"
613,00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.960,"the physical Bible,"
614,00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:28.480,"the physical,"
615,00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:28.620,"the,"
616,00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.180,"or the actual words of the scripture as the flesh,"
617,00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.140,right?
618,00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:32.500,"And,"
619,00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.280,and this is the outward manifestation or covering.
620,00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.500,"You could talk about the physical world as,"
621,00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.860,as a kind of flesh.
622,00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:40.880,"Um,"
623,00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.780,"but of course,"
624,00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.940,"when we're talking about Christ,"
625,00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.440,"we,"
626,00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.480,we need to be clear.
627,00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.800,"We're talking about the full,"
628,00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040,a full humanity.
629,00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.640,"He's a,"
630,00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.340,"he is a,"
631,00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.660,a full human being.
632,00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.640,"So when we talk about the flesh or the clothing,"
633,00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.700,"we're not just talking about,"
634,00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.600,"um,"
635,00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.580,"one aspect of,"
636,00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.400,"of a physical,"
637,00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.560,of a physical being.
638,00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.460,So that's the first thing.
639,00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.220,"Um,"
640,00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.960,"I may have,"
641,00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.340,"I may be passing over the second,"

663,00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.940,"it's not bread that's missing something because the,"
664,00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.000,the new Testament is the fulfillment of the old Testament.
665,00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.940,"So the old Testament,"

756,00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.260,but also one vice hangs on the other.
757,00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.380,"And so at the,"
758,00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:31.820,"this,"
759,00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.280,this goes from top to bottom.
760,00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.840,"So it starts at the top and then each,"
761,00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.840,"each virtue hangs from the,"
762,00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.340,from the next one.
763,00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.100,And so the beginning is simplicity.
764,00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.000,"So if you want to,"
765,00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.340,"if you want a spiritual life,"
766,00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:43.840,"we need,"
767,00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.240,"we need simplicity and look at,"
768,00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.640,"and if you look at the opposite,"
769,00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.120,the thing that's going to prevent you from having a spiritual life.
770,00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:50.800,"Oh,"
771,00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.160,I see.
772,00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:51.480,Yeah.
773,00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:51.760,Yeah.
774,00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.600,I see exactly what happened right now.
775,00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:53.840,Yeah.
776,00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:54.580,Yeah.
777,00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.300,"So,"
778,00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.060,"you know,"
779,00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.200,"in the world we live in,"
780,00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:57.860,"we have to,"
781,00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.320,"you know,"
782,00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.540,we have to survive and we have to work and we have to be part of the
783,00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.060,technological world.
784,00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.880,"But there are also,"
785,00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.680,"there's also a way to access a deeper,"
786,00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.160,a deeper reality.
787,00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.020,"And it starts with simplicity,"
788,00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.600,"with avoiding,"
789,00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.880,"with avoiding the slavery to pleasure,"
790,00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.200,which is what consumes us.
791,00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.160,We want to look at our phone.
792,00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.180,We want to be on the computer.
793,00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.280,We want to stay up late.
794,00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:22.840,"We want to,"
795,00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.580,we want to eat.
796,00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:23.860,Yeah.
797,00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:24.920,In my case.
798,00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.360,Right.
799,00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.600,So this is the beginning.
800,00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:26.880,Yeah.
801,00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.540,"I put it in the chat in case you,"
802,00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.760,in case anybody wants it.
803,00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.000,"Well,"
804,00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.380,"you know,"
805,00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.160,"now with,"
806,00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.100,"with artificial intelligence,"
807,00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.620,you can put any English text into a translator and it'll give you a very
808,00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.660,nice translation.
809,00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.020,"Well,"
810,00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.100,"at least,"
811,00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.040,"at least as a,"
812,00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.600,just to give you a general idea.
813,00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.620,Oh yeah.
814,00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.300,Yeah.
815,00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:45.800,"You don't want to,"
816,00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.200,"you don't want to make it the last,"
817,00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.980,"the last word on something,"
818,00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.980,but just as an opening.
819,00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:51.380,"I mean,"
820,00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:51.640,"you know,"
821,00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.160,"you have to be,"
822,00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.020,you have to be cautious.
823,00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.060,"You don't want to jump to conclusions based on,"
824,00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.660,"based on artificial translation,"
825,00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.420,"but we have,"
826,00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.520,"we have some lectures on,"
827,00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.580,"on the web,"
828,00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:02.920,"the,"
829,00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:03.280,"yeah,"
830,00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.060,the YouTube channel.
831,00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.740,The website also has other things like translations.
832,00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:08.960,"And,"
833,00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:09.580,"you know,"
834,00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.860,we have courses at Holy Cross that are open to outside applicants.
835,00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.620,"So if anyone wants to sign up to take a,"
836,00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.260,"to take a course at Holy Cross,"
837,00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.220,we have online courses.
838,00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:22.360,"One of the,"
839,00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.960,one of the courses we're teaching is in the fall is introduction to church
840,00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.440,fathers and also a course on St.
841,00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:31.740,"Gregory,"
842,00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.400,the theologian on his orations.
843,00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.320,And so you can even audit the class.
844,00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:37.940,"So you don't,"
845,00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.220,"you know,"

848,00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.400,"you're able to follow along,"
849,00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.300,"you can audit the class so that you don't have to do the,"

933,00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.780,as much as you're watching.
934,00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.880,"Yeah, that sounds like."
