# Commands Skill

A simple OVOS skill for running shell scripts and other commands. The commands execute quietly without requiring confirmation from OVOS.

## Features

- Run shell scripts or commands by speaking human-readable phrases.
- Configure aliases for easy-to-remember commands.
- Optionally run commands under a specific user's privileges.

## Usage

Trigger commands using phrases like:

- **"Hey Mycroft, launch command echo TEST"**
- **"Hey Mycroft, run script generate report"**

## Configuration

The skill can be configured to map spoken phrases to scripts or commands in the `settings.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  "alias": {
    "generate report": "/home/forslund/scripts/generate_report.sh"
  }
}
```

### Example:
- User says: **"Run script generate report"**  
- The skill executes: `/home/forslund/scripts/generate_report.sh`

### Additional Settings:

- **`user`** *(optional)*: Specify a username to run commands under their privileges. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "user": "ovos"
  }
  ```

- **`shell`** *(optional)*: Determines whether commands are executed via a shell. Defaults to `true`. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "shell": false
  }
  ```

### Full Configuration Example:
```json
{
  "user": "ovos",
  "alias": {
    "generate report": "/home/forslund/scripts/generate_report.sh",
    "update system": "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y",
    "reboot device": "sudo reboot"
  },
  "shell": true
}
```

## Security Notes

1. **Shell Commands**: 
   - By default, commands are executed via the shell, which allows complex operations but may expose security risks. If your commands donâ€™t require shell features, set `shell` to `false`.

2. **User Permissions**: 
   - Commands can run under a specific user by configuring the `user` field. Ensure that the user has appropriate permissions to execute the commands.

3. **Validation**:
   - Avoid configuring dangerous commands like `rm -rf` without additional safeguards.
