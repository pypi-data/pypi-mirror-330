# LMNT Python Library
The LMNT Python library provides convenient access to the LMNT API from applications written in the Python language.

[[Documentation]](https://docs.lmnt.com/sdk/python/introduction)

## Installation
Installing from PyPI is the quickest way to get started:

```sh
pip install --upgrade lmnt
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

## Getting started

The most common operation you'll perform is a `synthesize` request. Given some text and a voice, it will return an audio
file that you can play back. Take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.lmnt.com/sdk/python/introduction) for a deeper dive into the SDK.

```python
import asyncio

from lmnt.api import Speech


LMNT_API_KEY = ...  # fill in your API key here


async def main():
  async with Speech(LMNT_API_KEY) as speech:
    synthesis = await speech.synthesize('Hello, world.', voice='lily', format='wav')
    with open('output.wav', 'wb') as f:
      f.write(synthesis['audio'])


asyncio.run(main())
```

While you can provide an `api_key` argument, we recommend using `python-dotenv` to add `LMNT_API_KEY="My API Key"` to your `.env` file so that your API key is not stored in source control.
