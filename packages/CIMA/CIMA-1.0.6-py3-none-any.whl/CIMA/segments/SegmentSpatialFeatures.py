def GetLocalisationOverlap(structure1,structure2, radius=200):
    """
    Calculates the overlap between two structures within a specified radius.

    This function computes the proportion of pairs of points, one from `structure1` 
    and the other from `structure2`, that lie within a given distance (`radius`). 
    The overlap is calculated using the `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` structure, which 
    efficiently finds neighboring points within the specified radius.

    Args:
    * structure1: The first structure, expected to have a `Getcoord` method 
                    that returns its coordinates as an array.
    * structure2: The second structure, expected to have a `Getcoord` method 
                    that returns its coordinates as an array.
    * radius (float, optional): The maximum distance within which pairs of points 
                                  are considered overlapping. Defaults to 200.

    Returns:
    * float: The proportion of point pairs, one from each structure, that lie within 
               the specified radius.
