Home Assistant prefers using the built-in modern WebRTC provider registered by the {builtin_integration} integration.\n\nBenefits of the built-in integration are:\n\n- The camera stream is started faster.\n- More camera devices are supported.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can either keep using the built-in modern WebRTC provider and remove the {legacy_integration} integration or remove the {builtin_integration} integration to use the legacy provider, and then restart Home Assistant.",
