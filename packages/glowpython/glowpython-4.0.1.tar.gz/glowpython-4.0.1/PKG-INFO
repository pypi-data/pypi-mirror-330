            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# GlowPython

The FORTRAN GLobal airglOW ([GLOW](https://github.com/NCAR/GLOW)) Model in Python &ge; 3.7.

A Fortran compiler is **REQUIRED**.

<b>Note:</b> This version uses `meson` and `ninja` as the build system, and does not rely on `distutils`,
and is Python 3.12 compatible.

<b>This library also allows parallelization of model evaluation using the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module.</b>

Additionally, the `GlowModel` class exposes complete control over model evaluation, which is divided
into the following fundamental steps:
1. `initialize`: Set the altitude, energy grids and solar flux model (Hinteregger, EUVAC, custom).
2. `setup`: Set the model up for evaluation, specifying time, location, and optionally geomagnetic parameters. If geomagnetic parameters are not specified, they are retrieved using [`geomagdata`](https://pypi.org/project/geomagdata/).
3. `precipitation` (optional): Evaluate the energy and flux of precipitating electrons (Maxwellian or monoenergetic).
4. `atmosphere`: Evaluate the neutral atmosphere (MSISE-00) and ionosphere (IRI-90).
5. `radtrans`: Evaluate the GLOW radiative transfer model to calculate volume emission rates and ion composition.
6. `result`: Retrieve the model output as a [xarray.Dataset](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html).

<b>Note:</b> Between the `atmosphere` and `radtrans` steps, the intermediate dataset can be accessed using the `result` method by passing `copy=False`. This returns a reference to the internal dataset. Modifying the dataset in place allows for modifying the atmosphere and ionosphere presented to the `radtrans` step.

## Installation

<b>Note:</b> For macOS Big Sur and above, you may need to add the following line to your environment script (`~/.zshrc` if using ZSH, or the relevant shell init script):
```sh
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib"
```
Then reopen the terminal. This fixes the issue where `-lSystem` fails for `gfortran`. Additionally,
installation of `gfortran` using `homebrew` is required.

Direct installation using pip:
```sh
$ pip install glowpython
```

Install from source repository by:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sunipkm/glowpython -b development
$ cd glowpython && pip install .
```

Requires (and installs) [geomagdata](https://pypi.org/project/geomagdata/) for timezone aware geomagnetic parameter retrieval.

Then use examples such as:

* `Examples/Maxwellian.py`: Maxwellian precipitation, specify Q (flux) and E0 (characteristic energy).
* `Examples/NoPrecipitation.py`: No precipitating electrons.

These examples are also available on the command line: `GlowMaxwellian` and `GlowNoPrecip`.

Or, use GLOW in your own Python program by:
```python
import glowpython as glow

iono = glow.maxwellian(time, glat, glon, Nbins, Q, Echar)
```

Read the module documentation for more information.
