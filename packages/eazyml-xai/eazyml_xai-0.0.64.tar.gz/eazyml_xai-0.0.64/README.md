`eazyml-xai` is a Python package designed to make machine learning predictions more transparent and interpretable. It provides human-readable explanations for predictions.

### Features
- Gain insights into **local feature importance and global feature impacts**.
- Understand **why a specific prediction was made**.
- Evaluate predictions with **explainability scores**.    

`eazyml-xai` is a key tool for building trust in AI systems by providing clear, actionable explanations.

## Installation
### User installation
The easiest way to install EazyML Explainable AI is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-xai
```
### Dependencies
Eazyml Augmented Intelligence requires :
- pandas==2.0.3
- scikit-learn==1.3.2
- werkzeug==3.0.2
- Unidecode==1.3.8
- pydot==1.4.2
- numpy==1.24.3
- pyyaml

## Usage
Get explainability score for test data.
```python
from eazyml_augi import ez_init, ez_augi

# initialize: setup book-keeping, access_key if required 
_ = ez_init()

response = ez_explain(
            mode='classification',
            outcome='target',
            train_file_path='train.csv',
            test_file_path='test.csv',
            model=my_model,
            data_type_dict=data_type_dict,
            selected_features_list=lis_of_derived_features,
            options={"data_source": "parquet", "record_number": [1, 2, 3]})

explainations = response['explainations']
```
