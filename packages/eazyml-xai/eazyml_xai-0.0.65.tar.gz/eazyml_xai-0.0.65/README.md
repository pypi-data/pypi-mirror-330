`eazyml-xai` is a python package designed to make machine learning predictions more transparent and interpretable. It provides human-readable explanations for predictions.

### Features
- Gain insights into **local feature importance and global feature impacts**.
- Understand **why a specific prediction was made**.
- Evaluate predictions with **explainability scores**.    

`eazyml-xai` is a key tool for building trust in AI systems by providing clear, actionable explanations.

## Installation
To use the explainable ai, ensure you have Python installed on your system.
### User installation
The easiest way to install EazyML Explainable AI is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-xai
```
### Dependencies
This package requires:
- pandas,
- scikit-learn,
- werkzeug,
- Unidecode,
- pydot,
- numpy,
- pyyaml

## Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the APIs from this package.
```python
from eazyml_xai import ez_init, ez_explain

# initialize: setup book-keeping, access_key if required 
_ = ez_init()

response = ez_explain(
                train_data(`DataFrame/str`) = 'train_dataframe/train_data_path',
                outcome(`str`) = 'target',
                test_data(`DataFrame/str`) = 'test_dataframe/test_data_path',
                model(`Bytes/object`) = 'Encripted model_info from ez_build_model response or the trained model'
                options(`dict`) = {
                    "record_number"(`list of integer`): "Specify the record number of test data in the list on which you want to get the explanations"
                    "scaler"(`object`): "Trained scaler object"
                    "preprocessor"(`object`): "Trained preprocessor object"
            }
        )

explanations = response['explanations']
```
