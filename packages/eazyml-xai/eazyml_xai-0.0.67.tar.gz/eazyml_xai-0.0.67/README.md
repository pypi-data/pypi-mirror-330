`eazyml-xai` is a python package designed to make machine learning predictions more transparent and interpretable. It provides human-readable explanations for predictions.

### Features
- Gain insights into **local feature importance and global feature impacts**.
- Understand **why a specific prediction was made**.
- Evaluate predictions with **explainability scores**.    

`eazyml-xai` is a key tool for building trust in AI systems by providing clear, actionable explanations.

## Installation
To use the explainable ai, ensure you have Python installed on your system.
### User installation
The easiest way to install EazyML Explainable AI is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-xai
```
### Dependencies
This package requires:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- werkzeug
- Unidecode
- pydot
- numpy
- pyyaml
- xgboost

## Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the APIs from this package.
```python
from eazyml_xai import ez_init, ez_explain

# initialize: setup book-keeping, access_key if required 
_ = ez_init()

response = ez_explain(
                train_data = 'train.csv',
                outcome = 'target',
                test_data = 'test.csv',
                model_info = '<trained model object>',
                options = {
                    "record_number": [1, 2, 3],
                    "scaler": '<trained scaler object>',
                    "preprocessor": '<trained preprocessor object>'
            }
        )

# reponse object contains a dictionary with explanations for the user specified record numbers. 
```
