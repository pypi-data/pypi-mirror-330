"""
Defines algorithms to locate any workRID in a complex of:
-   share points, numbered 0..n (the actual file server and client determines the
    full path. The share point returned is a digit, it's up to the file server to
    serve a resource that ends in a digit. (the client has a mount point which can
    be any arbitrary string, as long as it ends in a digit.
    Ex:  Rackstation 5 (TBRCRS5) has share points Archive0 and Archive1
    - MacOS Client mounts these shares as /Volumes/Archive0 and /Volumes/Archive1
    - Linux client can be more flexible, but for scripts sake it should be the same:
        - /mnt/Archive0 mounts /RS5/Archive0
        - /mnt/Archive1 mounts /RS5/Archive1
-   buckets: the location of the work in a set of sub folders of the share point
