v0.8 (unreleased)
-----------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add date to info string in quicklook (`#252 <https://github.com/discos/srt-single-dish-tools/pull/252>`__)


v0.7.0 (2025-01-24)
-------------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Save average cross scans in FITS extensions, with uncertainties (`#247 <https://github.com/discos/srt-single-dish-tools/pull/247>`__)
- New script to analyze RFI content of observations, and way to apply filters (`#248 <https://github.com/discos/srt-single-dish-tools/pull/248>`__)


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fix incompatibility with Astropy 6+ (`#238 <https://github.com/discos/srt-single-dish-tools/pull/238>`__)
- Support new naming for summary file (`#242 <https://github.com/discos/srt-single-dish-tools/pull/242>`__)
