.. towncrier release notes start

0.3.2 (2025-03-02)
==================

Maintenance

- Drop support python 3.8 and add explicit support for python 3.13. (`#108 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/108>`_)
- Fix API changes in user guide and rename ``ll`` to ``low_loss`` consistently. (`#109 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/109>`_)


0.3.1 (2024-10-16)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix preferences import when using Hartree-Slater GOS and re-introduce undocumented import used by ``atomap``. (`#90 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/90>`_)


0.3 (2024-10-11)
================

New features
------------

- Support for `Dirac GOS <https://zenodo.org/records/12800856>`_ in the gosh format for EELS quantification, which includes the relativistic effects (e.g. spin-orbit coupling) based on Dirac equation. (`#72 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/72>`_)


Enhancements
------------

- Make ``numexpr`` an optional dependency to allow installation in pyodide. (`#80 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/80>`_)
- Mention source of :attr:`~exspy.material.elements` database in docstring (`#87 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/87>`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Add back functionalities, which were unintentionally removed from public API when splitting from hyperspy in :mod:`exspy.utils.eds`, :mod:`exspy.utils.eels` and :mod:`exspy.material`. (`#59 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/59>`_)
- :meth:`exspy.models.EDSModel.fit_background` fixes:

  - fix error when using linear fitting,
  - fix resetting signal range after fitting background,
  - suspend plot when fitting background. (`#76 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/76>`_)
- Plot background and integration windows fixes and improvements:

  - fix plotting windows with navigation dimension >=2,
  - raise improved error message when windows are out of the range of the signal, (`#86 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/86>`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Fix examples in user guide, which needed to be updated after the split from hyperspy. (`#59 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/59>`_)


0.2.1 (2024-07-12)

- Fix deprecation scipy and numpy warnings. (`#33 <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy/issues/33>`_)


0.1 (2023-12-03)
================

New features
------------
- Support for tabulated :ref:`Generalised Oscillator Strengths (GOS) <eels.GOS>` using the
  `GOSH <https://gitlab.com/gguzzina/gosh>`_ open file format. By default, a freely
  usable dataset is downloaded from `doi:10.5281/zenodo.7645765 <https://zenodo.org/record/6599071>`_

Initiation (2023-10-28)
=======================

- eXSpy was split out of the `HyperSpy repository
  <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy>`_ on Oct. 28, 2023. The X-ray energy
  dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and energy electron loss spectroscopy (EELS)
  functionalities so far developed in HyperSpy were moved to the
  `eXSpy repository <https://github.com/hyperspy/exspy>`_.
