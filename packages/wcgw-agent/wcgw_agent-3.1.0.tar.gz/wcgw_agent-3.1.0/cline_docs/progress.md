## Completed Work

### Core Windows Compatibility (100% Complete)
- ✅ Platform detection utilities (`platform_utils.py`)
- ✅ Cross-platform shell handler abstraction (`shell_handler.py`)
- ✅ Windows-specific shell handler implementation (`WindowsShellHandler` class)
- ✅ Windows background process management (`windows_bg_process.py`)

- ✅ Created PUBLISHING.md for release instructions

### Packaging and Distribution (95% Complete)
- ✅ Updated pyproject.toml with new version and Windows compatibility
- ✅ Added platform-specific dependencies (pexpect as Unix-only)
- ✅ Added classifiers for Windows support
- ✅ Split dependencies into cross-platform and platform-specific
- ✅ Changed package name from "wcgw" to "wcgw-agent" due to PyPI name conflict
