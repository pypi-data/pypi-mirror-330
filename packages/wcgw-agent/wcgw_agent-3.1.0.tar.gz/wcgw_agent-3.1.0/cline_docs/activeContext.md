# Active Context: Windows Compatibility for WCGW

## Current Work

We are implementing and testing Windows compatibility for the WCGW MCP server. This involves:

1. Creating platform-agnostic utilities for system interaction
2. Developing Windows-specific alternatives to Unix-only functionality
3. Testing all features to ensure cross-platform compatibility
4. Updating documentation to reflect Windows support
5. Preparing for PyPI publishing

## Recent Changes

### Platform Abstraction
- Created `platform_utils.py` module for platform detection and abstraction
- Implemented cross-platform methods for common operations

### Shell Handling
- Developed `shell_handler.py` with platform-specific implementations:
  - `PexpectShellHandler` for Unix-based systems
  - `WindowsShellHandler` for Windows using subprocess and custom expect emulation

### Screen Replacement
- Created `windows_bg_process.py` to replace Unix 'screen' functionality
- Implemented background process management on Windows (creation, listing, termination)

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite in `test_windows_compatibility.py`
- Implemented 21 test cases covering all functionality across platforms

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with Windows-specific setup instructions
- Created feature_parity.md documenting cross-platform implementation details
- Created CHANGELOG.md and PUBLISHING.md for release preparation

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize PyPI Publishing**
   - Complete packaging setup
   - Updated package name to "wcgw-agent" due to name conflict on PyPI
   - Test installation from PyPI
   - Publish the Windows-compatible version

2. **Extended Testing**
   - Test on different Windows versions
   - Verify compatibility with various shell configurations

3. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Create detailed Windows troubleshooting guide
   - Add examples of Windows-specific usage

4. **Future Features**
   - Consider adding Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) support
   - Explore more Windows-specific optimizations
