              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# dagster-ssis
Package to allow observability of SSIS and MSSQL jobs

This simplifies the tracking of SSIS and MSSQL jobs in SQL Server to use as upstream dependencies for other dagster assets.

## Requirements

### Drivers

You need the ODBC drivers installed on the machine that is running the dagster pipeline.

See [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16) for more information.

### Permissions

For SSIS the user must be a member of the role `ssis_logreader` or have permissions to read from the `catalog.executions` view.

For MSSQL Jobs the user must be able to select from `msdb.dbo.sysjobs` and `msdb.dbo.sysjobhistory`. 
The Easiest method is to grant `SELECT` on these two tables as the default roles grant much higher levels of privilage then required.

## SSIS

Creates an asset to represent an SSIS Package and the assets (tables, etc.) that are generated by it.

This captures executions outside of dagster, but reports events to be
triggered and responded to by downstream assets, such as dbt.

### SSISAsset Usage

Two primary methods to use the assets.
The asset key will be `Folder + Project Name + Package Name`.

```python
# Create a single SSIS Asset
ssis_asset = SSISAsset(
    project_name='Project',
    package_name'Package.dtsx'
)

# get a list with a single asset spec for the SSIS package
asset_spec = ssis_asset.asset_specs
```

```python
# Create a single SSIS Asset representing multiple other assets, such as table in MSSQL, or a stored proceedure
# This pattern is good if the asset should be defined differently then the package itself.

table_assets = [
    AssetSpec(key='my_table'), AssetSpec(key='my_other_table')
]

ssis_asset = SSISAsset(
    project_name='Project',
    package_name'Package.dtsx',
    asset_list=table_assets
)
# get the list of all the assets, including the package asset
asset_spec = ssis_asset.asset_specs
```

```python
# using helper function `build_ssis_assets`, produce the same as above
# this assigns the key of the sub assets to the ssis path

# Good for composing the ssis package and all related assets together
ssis_asset = build_ssis_assets(
    project_name='Project',
    package_name'Package.dtsx',
    asset_list=['my_table', 'my_other_table']
)

# get the list of all the assets, including the package asset
asset_spec = ssis_asset.asset_specs
```

To pass anything along to the asset spec created, pass a dictionary of arguments to `asset_spec_kwargs`. These will be sent along to the `AssetSpec` for the asset, or sub assets.

```python
ssis_asset = build_ssis_assets(
    project_name='Project',
    package_name'Package.dtsx',
    asset_list=['my_table', 'my_other_table'],
    asset_spec_kwargs={
        'owner': 'someone',
        'skippable': True,
        'metadata': {
            'my_meta': 'data'
        }
    }
)
```

### Sensor

To report the materialization events, a sensor can be used to check the `ssisdb` for completed or successful events from the `catalog.executions` view.

You will need a resource defined that connects to the database and exposes a `connect` function, which returns a SQLAlchemy connection object.

this can be created with `build_ssis_asset_sensor`

Continuing from the example above

```python

ssis_sensor = build_ssis_asset_sensor(
    ssis_assets=[ssis_asset],
    sensor_name='ssis_sensor',
    database_resource_key='my_db_resource'
)

```

## Jobs

To represent the execution of a MSSQL Job, it is defined through a MSSQLJobSpec.

The user must be able to select from `msdb.dbo.sysjobs` and `msdb.dbo.sysjobhistory`
Easiest method is to grant `SELECT` on these two tables.

### MSSQL Job Asset

Two primary methods to use the assets.
The asset key will either be `MSSQLJob + Job Name` or if using the helper function, `MSSQLJob + Job Name + Job Name` to allow other assets to sit along side it.

```python
# single asset
job_asset = MSSQLJobAsset(
    job_name='job_name',
)

# or adding specific specs to capture alongside
job_asset = MSSQLJobAsset(
    job_name='job_name', asset_list=[AssetSpec('a'), AssetSpec('b')]
)
```

```python
# single asset from helper with child assets
job_asset = build_mssql_job_assets(
    "job_name", asset_list=["other_asset"]
)
```

As above, you can also pass the keyword args to the AssetSpec using `asset_spec_kwargs`

### MSSQL Job Sensor

To report the materialization events, a sensor can be used to check the `msdb` for completed or successful events from the `dbo.sysjobhistories` table.

You will need a resource defined that connects to the database and exposes a `connect` function, which returns a SQLAlchemy connection object.

The sensor can be created with `build_mssql_job_asset_sensor`

## Complete Example

```python
from dagster_ssis import (
    SQLServerResource,
    build_ssis_assets, build_ssis_asset_sensor,
    MSSQLJobAsset, build_mssql_job_asset_sensor
)

my_db_resource = SQLServerResource(
    host='localhost',
    database='MyDB',
    username='...',
    password='...',
    query_props={
        "driver": "ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server",
        "TrustServerCertificate": "yes",
    }
)

ssis_asset_a = build_ssis_assets(
    project_name='Project',
    package_name'Package.dtsx',
    asset_list=['my_table', 'my_other_table'],
    asset_spec_kwargs={
        'owner': 'someone',
        'skippable': True,
        'metadata': {
            'my_meta': 'data'
        }
    }
)

ssis_asset_b = build_ssis_assets(
    project_name='Project2',
    package_name'Package.dtsx',
    asset_list=['something_else'],
    asset_spec_kwargs={
        'owner': 'someone',
        'skippable': True,
        'metadata': {
            'my_meta': 'data'
        }
    }
)

# a single job sensor
job_assets = MSSQLJobAsset(
    'job_name'
)

# tie ssis assets to a job exeuction check
# you probably want to exclude checking using ssis and use the job instead if adding ssis assets
ssis_job_assets = MSSQLJobAsset(
    'job_name_ssis',
    asset_list=ssis_asset_b.asset_specs
)

# only check for a, as b is now tied to a job sensor
ssis_sensor = build_ssis_asset_sensor(
    ssis_assets=[ssis_asset_a],
    sensor_name='ssis_sensor',
    database_resource_key='my_db_resource'
)

mssql_job_sensor = build_mssql_job_asset_sensor(
    [job_assets, ssis_job_assets],
    sensor_name='mssql_job_sensor',
    database_resource_key='my_db_resource'
)

Definition(
    # add all the assets. only add either ssis_asset_b or the job specs otherwise it will find duplicates 
    assets=ssis_asset_a.asset_specs + ssis_job_assets.asset_specs + job_assets.asset_specs,
    sensors=[ssis_sensor, mssql_job_sensor],
    resources={
        'my_db_resource': my_db_resource
    }
)
```
