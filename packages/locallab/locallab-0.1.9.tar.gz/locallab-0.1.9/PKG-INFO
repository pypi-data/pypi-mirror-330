LocalLab is a powerful, lightweight AI inference server designed to deliver cutting-edge language model capabilities on your local machine or through Google Colab. It empowers developers and researchers to run sophisticated AI models on local hardware, optimizing resources with advanced features such as dynamic model loading, memory optimizations, and real-time system monitoring.

## What Problem Does LocalLab Solve?

- **Local Inference:** Run advanced language models without relying on expensive cloud services.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilize state-of-the-art techniques like quantization, attention slicing, and CPU offloading for maximum efficiency.
- **Seamless Deployment:** Easily switch between local deployment and Google Colab, leveraging ngrok for public accessibility.
- **Effective Resource Management:** Automatically monitor and manage CPU, RAM, and GPU usage to ensure smooth operation.

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

| Component | Local Deployment | Google Colab           |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| RAM       | 4GB              | Free tier (12GB)       |
| CPU       | 2 cores          | 2 cores                |
| Python    | 3.8+             | 3.8+                   |
| Storage   | 2GB free         | -                      |
| GPU       | Optional         | Available in free tier |

### Recommended Requirements

## Get Started

1. **Installation:**

   ```bash
   pip install locallab
   ```

2. **Starting the Server Locally:**

   ```python
   from locallab import start_server
   start_server()
   ```

3. **Starting the Server on Google Colab:**

   ```python
   !pip install locallab
   import os
   os.environ["NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN"] = "your_token_here"
   from locallab import start_server
   start_server(ngrok=True)
   ```

4. **Connecting your Client:**
   ```python
   from locallab.client import LocalLabClient
   client = LocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000")  # Use ngrok URL for Colab deployment
   ```
