# {project_name}

This project was generated with [create-np-app](https://github.com/nikolaiborbe/create-nb-app).

## Features

- **Git Repository:** Automatically initialized.
- **Virtual Environment:** An isolated environment created in `venv/`.
- **Selected Tools:** 
    - Static Type Checking with mypy.
    - Code Formatting with Black.
    - Linting with Flake8.
    - Testing with pytest.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Configured to run checks before commits.
- **Additional Files:** CITATION.cff and MIT License.

## Testing with pytest

To run tests, simply execute:

```bash
pytest
```
This will discover and run all tests in the tests/ directory.

## Linting with Flake8

Flake8 checks your code for style and programming errors. For example, it will warn you if you have an unused variable or formatting issues.

### Getting Started
1. Activate your virtual environment:
- On Unix/macOS: ```source venv/bin/activate```
- On Windows: ```venv\\Scripts\\activate```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start coding! ðŸš€
