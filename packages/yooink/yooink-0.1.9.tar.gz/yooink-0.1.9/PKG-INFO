# yooink

A Python package to access Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) data via 
the m2m (machine to machine) interface. This project has been built with 
the help of various tutorials and examples provided by the OOI, most 
notably [the python section of their repository](https://github.com/oceanobservatories/ooi-data-explorations/tree/master/python/ooi_data_explorations),
which was written mostly (or entirely) by [Chris Wingard](https://github.com/cwingard) at OOI.

## Quick Setup

You can install this package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yooink/) using:

```bash
pip install yooink
```

## Usage

For more information about how to install and use yooink, check out the 
[yooink documentation site](https://waveform-analytics.github.io/yooink/).
