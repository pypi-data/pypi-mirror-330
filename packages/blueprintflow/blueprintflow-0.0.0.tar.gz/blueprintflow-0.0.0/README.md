# BlueprintFlow

BlueprintFlow aims to simplify code generation through abstractions and structured data retrieval, allowing developers to create high-quality, modularized code with reduced overhead and adherence to established standards.

## Overview

### Goals

- **Systematic Approach**: ensure structured and consistent code generation.
- **Architecture Replication**: replicate existing architectural structures.
- **Reduced Overhead**: minimize the initial development.
- **Modularity**: facilitate the creation of reusable, independent components.

### Generative AI

- **Code Generation**: automate the production of efficient, modular code.
- **Abstraction Generation**: create high-level, reusable code structures using AI.

### User Interaction

- **Q&A**: provide question and answer mechanisms to support development needs.
- **Chat**: allow user to communicate with AI through a chat interface.
- **Configuration**: allow tool customization for tailored usage.
- **Software Library**: provide reusable components and modules.
- **Validation Checks**: ensure the code generated meets quality standards.

### Content Validation

- **Code Failure by Default**: fail code generated without human validation.
- **Function Calling**: allow custom validations through function calling.
- **Traceability**: track content generation up to its origins.
- **Watermarks**: embed identifiers for metadata purposes.

### Information Retrieval

- **RAG**: use Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- **GraphRAG**: use graph-based approaches for structured data access.
- **Contextual Retrieval**: enhance efficiency by considering retrieval context.
- **Query Expansion Retrieval**: refine search queries for more relevant results.

### Storage

- **VectorStore**: store abstractions and high-quality code along with their vectors.
- **GraphDB**: store guidelines and rules in graph structures.

### Tech Stack

### Philosophy

- **Offline-First**: prioritize software that works seamlessly without internet connection.
- **Local Privacy**: store all data locally.
- **Open-Source**: promote transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development.
