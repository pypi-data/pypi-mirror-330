# Thor's Hammer - Python Edition
(The name sounds way cooler in my head I swear)
<!-- 
Fun facts:
1. The name Thor's Hammer refer to the weapon of the Norse Mythology's God, Thor, which is named Mjolnir, hence why the command to run this program is "mjolnir".
2. It's also a reference to Resident Evil 7's Not a Hero DLC, where Chris Redfield shotgun is called "Thor's Hammer".
