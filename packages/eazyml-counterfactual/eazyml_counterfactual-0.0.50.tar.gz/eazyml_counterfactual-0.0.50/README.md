`eazyml-counterfactual` is a Python package that helps users optimize predictive outcomes by generating counterfactual explanations.
EazyML revolutionizes machine learning by introducing counterfactual inference, automating the process of identifying optimal changes to variables that shift outcomes from unfavorable to favorable. This approach overcomes the limitations of manual "what-if" analysis, enabling models to provide actionable, prescriptive insights alongside their predictions.

Designed for post-prediction analysis, the package answers questions like:
- "What minimal changes to input features can reverse an unfavorable prediction?"
- "How can I achieve a desired outcome by tweaking feature values?"

### Features
- **Counterfactual Explanations**: Identify feature changes required to alter predictions.
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Generate actionable recommendations to achieve better outcomes.
- It performs feature selection from a training dataset by excluding specific columns and the target outcome column.
- This function builds a machine learning model using a specified training dataset.
- It provides platform to automates counterfactual inference for a test record by calculating the probability of an unfavorable outcome and determining the optimal adjustments to minimize it. It processes input datasets, configuration parameters, and model details to identify actionable changes in features while respecting constraints, enabling prescriptive insights for improved outcomes.

`eazyml-counterfactual` is ideal for scenarios like fraud detection, loan approvals, and customer churn prevention.`

## Installation
### User installation
The easiest way to install counterfactual package is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-counterfactual
```
### Dependencies
Eazyml Augmented Intelligence requires :
- pandas
- matplotlib
- openpyxl
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pyyaml

## Usage
Counterfactual can be used by initalizing EazyML and then getting insights for new test data.

```python
from eazyml_augi import ez_init, ez_augi

# initialize: setup book-keeping, access_key if required 
_ = ez_init()

selected_features = ['list of all the features in test or train data']
invariants = ['list of columns which should not be varying']
variants = ['list of columns which should be varying']

# Defining configurable parameters for counterfactual inference
options = {   
    "variants": variants,
    "outcome_ordinality": "SATISFIED",
    "train_data": train_file
}

# Specify the index of the test record for which counterfactual inference will be performed
test_index_no = 0
# pred_df it contains test dataframe with predicted output for outcome in probability term.
test_data = pred_df.loc[[test_index_no]]

result = ez_cf_inference(
                    test_data,
                    outcome,
                    selected_features,
                    {"model_info": model_info},
                    options
                    )
```
