## FAQs:

### Badge collection
When you arrive at the venue, you will need to open your Digital Access Pass to show to our agents at the perimeter. Once this has been checked, you will enter the access scanning lanes. Here we will scan the QR code on your Digital Access Pass and provide you with a networking badge.
Your networking badge will only be given to you when you first access the venue. If you are returning, you will only be asked to scan the QR code on your Digital Access Pass.
The networking badge can be used inside the venue for lead retrieval purposes and access to conference and other sessions (subject to eligibility). It cannot be used for perimeter access or access to the Ministerial Programme.
If you leave your networking badge at your accommodation, we do have a small number of reprint desks at all entrances.

### MWC App
Your Digital Access Pass will be available in the MWC series app from early February 2025. This will not only give you access at the perimeter of the event but also to gain access to internal conference sessions / programmes (subject to pass type / approvals).
The MWC series app also ensures attendees can make the most of their experience by easily organising their schedule, enjoy networking features, joining conferences and getting inspiration from some of the most influential leaders from our industry.
Make sure you stay logged in, throughout the event, and that you always have sufficient charge to access the app at any time within the venue. 
If you need help accessing this, please see our [HELP GUIDE](https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/digital-access-pass-guide).
