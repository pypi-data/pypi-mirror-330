This session will explore how cutting-edge innovations are reshaping these industries, both at live events and in the digital realm. \nIn stadiums and venues worldwide, connectivity solutions are revolutionizing the fan journey from \"driveway to driveway.\" Mobile apps now provide real-time updates on travel, parking, and queuing times, while frictionless payment systems streamline transactions. Sharing special moments with those not in attendance has become integral, with US stadiums reporting record-breaking data usage at major events like Taylor Swift concerts. For at-home viewers, advanced on-screen graphics and AI-driven insights are elevating the virtual fan experience.\nMeanwhile, gaming is experiencing exponential growth, with 58% of adults playing weekly across devices. Mobile and cloud gaming are fueling this surge, with cloud gaming expected to grow from $2.4 billion in 2024 to $8.2 billion by 2025. Innovations like XR, cross-platform play, and esports are redefining engagement, while AI is unlocking new possibilities in game design and player interactivity.\nAs technology continues to redefine fan engagement across industries, organisations must harness these innovations to build stronger connections and optimise business strategies.\nThis is the focus of our keynote presentation: Vladimir Liulka, Founder &amp; CEO of Blocksport, will explore how a mobile Superapp, powered by a Consumer Data Platform (CDP), is revolutionizing fan engagement. Discover how consolidating multiple touchpoints enables organizations to collect and analyze fan data while maintaining direct audience relationships. Learn how this integrated approach enhances personalisation, boosts revenue, and strengthens marketing—all with full data ownership. The session will feature real-world case studies, including Blocksport’s work with Deutsche Telekom and Telekom Baskets Bonn, showcasing the business impact of data-driven fan engagement.\nOur afternoon panel, \"Immersive and Emerging Technologies Reshaping the Sports and Entertainment Landscape\", will explore how immersive experiences are redefining audience interaction across these sectors and discuss how XR is transforming fan engagement, entertainment, and gaming. \nFull Afternoon Agenda\n12:30 – 12:50: Keynote \"Mobile Fan Experience: Turning Passion into Business Intelligence\" by Vladimir Liulka, Founder &amp; CEO of Blocksport\n12:50 – 13:20: Panel Discussion: \"Immersive and Emerging Technologies Reshaping the Sports and Entertainment Landscape\" moderated by Faisal Zia, GSMA, and joined by Marko Jovanovic of Ericsson, Samir Ceric of Blocksport and Barry Dubovsky of Mondia.\n13:20 - 13:50: Panel Discussion: \"Bundling Is The Game - How Telcos Power Sports &amp; Entertainment Subscriptions\".
