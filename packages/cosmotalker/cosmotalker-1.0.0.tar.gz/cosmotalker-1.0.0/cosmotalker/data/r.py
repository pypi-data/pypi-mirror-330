   "rhea":'''Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn after Titan, is an icy world with a heavily cratered surface and faint traces of a thin atmosphere composed mainly of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Its surface is covered with bright, reflective ice, making it one of the most reflective moons in the solar system. Unlike its more active neighbor Enceladus, Rhea shows no signs of internal geological activity, indicating that it has been a geologically dead world for billions of years. Some studies suggest that Rhea might have a tenuous ring system, which, if confirmed, would make it the only known moon with rings. Though not considered a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life, studying Rhea helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of icy moons in the outer solar system.'''
