    "jupiter":'''Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the solar system. With a diameter of '139,820 km', it is more than 11 times wider than Earth. Jupiter is a gas giant composed mainly of 'hydrogen and helium' and lacks a solid surface. Its atmosphere features powerful storms, including the famous 'Great Red Spot', a massive storm that has raged for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and emits more heat than it receives from the Sun. It takes '12 Earth years' to complete one orbit around the Sun, while its fast rotation of about '9.9 hours' makes it the fastest-spinning planet. Jupiter has at least '95 moons', including 'Ganymede', the largest moon in the solar system. Its immense gravity influences the orbits of nearby celestial bodies and plays a crucial role in shaping the solar system.'''
