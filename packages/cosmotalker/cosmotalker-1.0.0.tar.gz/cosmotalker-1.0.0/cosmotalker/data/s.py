    "styx":''''Styx' is the smallest known moon of Pluto, discovered in 2012 using the Hubble Space Telescope. It has an irregular shape and an estimated diameter of about 16 kilometers. 'Styx' orbits Pluto at an average distance of approximately 42,000 kilometers and takes around 20 days to complete one revolution.  

The surface of 'Styx' is believed to be composed mainly of water ice, similar to Pluto’s other small moons. Like 'Nix', 'Hydra', and 'Kerberos', 'Styx' exhibits chaotic rotation, meaning it tumbles unpredictably as it orbits Pluto due to the gravitational influence of Pluto and 'Charon'. Observations from the New Horizons spacecraft in 2015 confirmed its small size and irregular shape but did not provide detailed images of its surface.  

Scientists believe 'Styx', along with Pluto’s other small moons, formed from debris created by a massive impact that led to the formation of the Pluto-Charon system. Despite its tiny size, 'Styx' plays a role in the intricate gravitational interactions within Pluto’s moon system.''',
    "sao":''''Sao' is one of Neptune’s irregular moons, discovered in 2002 using ground-based telescopes. It has an estimated diameter of about 44 kilometers and follows a distant, inclined, and prograde orbit, meaning it moves in the same direction as Neptune’s rotation. Unlike many of Neptune’s other irregular moons, which have retrograde orbits, 'Sao’s' prograde motion suggests that it may have formed from a captured Kuiper Belt object or from debris left over after a collision.  

'Sao' orbits Neptune at an average distance of about 22.4 million kilometers, taking nearly 9.3 years to complete one revolution. Its highly elliptical orbit makes it susceptible to gravitational disturbances, which could alter its trajectory over time. Due to its small size and great distance, very little is known about its surface composition, but it is believed to be composed of ice and rock, similar to other small outer moons of Neptune.''',
    "salacia":'''Salacia is a possible dwarf planet and a large trans-Neptunian object (TNO) located in the Kuiper Belt. It has an estimated diameter of about '850 km' and follows an orbit around the Sun that takes approximately '274 Earth years' to complete. Salacia is relatively dark compared to other large TNOs, suggesting a surface composed mostly of 'water ice and possibly organic compounds'. It has one known moon, 'Actaea', which orbits closely and helps scientists estimate its mass and density. Due to its size and likely irregular shape, Salacia’s classification as a **dwarf planet** remains uncertain, though some researchers believe it may meet the criteria.''',
    "sun": '''The Sun is a 'G-type main-sequence star (G2V)' at the center of our solar system, about '4.6 billion years old'. It has a diameter of '1.39 million km', a mass '330,000 times that of Earth', and generates energy through 'nuclear fusion' in its '15 million°C core'. Its structure includes the 'core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, and corona'. The Sun follows an '11-year solar cycle', influencing solar activity like 'sunspots, solar flares, and solar wind', which impact Earth's space weather. In about '5 billion years', it will expand into a 'red giant' before collapsing into a 'white dwarf'.''',
    "saturn":'''Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, with a diameter of '116,460 km'. It is best known for its spectacular ring system, composed of 'ice, rock, and dust particles'. Saturn is a gas giant primarily made of 'hydrogen and helium' and has a low density, making it the only planet that would float in water. It has a fast rotation period of about '10.7 hours' and takes '29.5 Earth years' to complete one orbit around the Sun. Saturn has a strong magnetic field and experiences extreme weather, including powerful storms and high-speed winds. The planet has at least '146 moons', with 'Titan' being the largest and the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere. Saturn’s unique rings and moons make it one of the most fascinating planets to study.''',
    "sedna":'''Sedna is a distant trans-Neptunian object and one of the most extreme known **possible dwarf planets** in the solar system. It has an estimated diameter of about '995 km' and follows an exceptionally elongated orbit that takes approximately '11,400 Earth years' to complete one revolution around the Sun. At its farthest point, Sedna is nearly '937 AU' (astronomical units) from the Sun, placing it in the outermost regions of the solar system. Its surface is believed to be covered with 'methane, nitrogen, and tholin' compounds, giving it a reddish hue. Sedna experiences some of the coldest temperatures in the solar system, with surface temperatures as low as '-240°C'. Its discovery in '2003' suggested the presence of a new region beyond the Kuiper Belt, possibly part of the hypothesized 'inner Oort Cloud'. Due to its extreme distance and long orbit, Sedna remains one of the most mysterious objects in the solar system and is a strong candidate for classification as a dwarf planet.'''
