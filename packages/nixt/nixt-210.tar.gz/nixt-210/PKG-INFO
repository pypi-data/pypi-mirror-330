NAME

::

    nixt - NIXT


SYNOPSIS

::

    >>> from nixt.object import Object, dumps, loads
    >>> o = Object()
    >>> o.a = "b"
    >>> print(loads(dumps(o))
    {'a': 'b'}


INSTALL

::

    $ pip install nixt


DESCRIPTION

::

    ``NIXT`` has all you need to program a unix cli program, such as disk
    perisistence for configuration files, event handler to handle the
    client/server connection, deferred exception handling to not crash
    on an error, etc.

    ``NIXT`` contains python3 code to program objects in a functional way. It
    provides a base Object class that has only dunder methods, all methods
    are factored out into functions with the objects as the first argument.
    It is called Object Programming (OP), OOP without the oriented.

    ``NIXT`` allows for easy json save//load to/from disk of objects. It
    provides an "clean namespace" Object class that only has dunder
    methods, so the namespace is not cluttered with method names. This
    makes storing and reading to/from json possible.
