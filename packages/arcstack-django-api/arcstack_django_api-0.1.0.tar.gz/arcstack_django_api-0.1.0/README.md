This is a simple API framework for Django. It is designed to be simple and follow
the Django way of doing things with class-based views.

## FAQ

### Why another API framework? Isn't there already a lot of them?

Yes, there are a lot of API frameworks for Django. Some of them also using `pydantic`
to validate the request data like `django-ninja`. But all of them have high and steep
learning curve.

I just want a simple API framework that is easy to learn and use.
