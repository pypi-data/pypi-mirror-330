What's the cheapest bridge design you can come up with?
To get the suggested design (if there is one) run the following.

>>> suggested_design = buildy.suggest_a_design()

How much does it cost?

>>> cost = buildy.calculate_design_cost(suggested_design)

Build the bridge & simulate it.

>>> bridge = buildy.build_bridge(suggested_design)

Process the results.

>>> success, feedback, beams = bridge.assess_for_breaks()
