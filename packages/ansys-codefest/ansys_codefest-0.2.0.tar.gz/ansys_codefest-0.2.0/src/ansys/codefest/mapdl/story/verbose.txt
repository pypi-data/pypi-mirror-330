This is a cavern, viewed side-on. You must build a bridge
that gets from 1 to 2 and supports 1 ton of weight on each
node of the path between them. You have a working design
already (see suggested design), but it's too expensive!
It's just made out of solid steel and it's way over budget.
How cheap can you make it without the bridge collapsing?

>>> design = lab.suggest_a_design()

Fixed nodes, like the rocks and the start/end points are not
included in this design. You can get a list of all the fixed
nodes and their numbers with the get_fixed_nodes method.

>>> fixed = lab.get_fixed_nodes()

How much does the suggestion cost (in dollars)?

>>> cost = lab.calculate_design_cost(design)

Build the bridge & simulate it.

>>> bridge = lab.build_bridge(design)

Process the results.

>>> success, feedback, beams = bridge.assess_for_breaks()

beams is a list of 'Beam' objects and each has a property 'stress',
that tells you how much that beam experienced.
