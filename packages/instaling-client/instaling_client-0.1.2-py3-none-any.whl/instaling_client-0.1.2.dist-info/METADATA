# Instaling Client

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/instaling-client.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/instaling-client/)

A Python client for automating Instaling language learning sessions. This package provides a convenient way to interact with the Instaling platform programmatically.
It is much faster than instaling-solver since the basis of it is the API of the website itself, not a selenium instance.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install instaling-client
```

## Examples

### Complete Daily Session

```python
from instaling_client import InstalingClient

client = InstalingClient()
try:
    client.login("your-email@example.com", "your-password")
    
    if client.session_completed:
        print("Today's session is already completed!")
    else:
        print("Starting today's session...")
        client.solve_quiz()
        print("Session completed successfully!")
        
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Authentication error: {e}")
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    print(f"HTTP error: {e}")
```
