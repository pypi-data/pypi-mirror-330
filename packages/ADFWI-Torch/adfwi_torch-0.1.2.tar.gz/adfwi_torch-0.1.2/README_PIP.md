# Automatic Differentiation-Based Full Waveform Inversion

---

## üë©‚Äçüíª Introduction
**ADFWI** is an open-source framework for high-resolution subsurface parameter estimation by minimizing discrepancies between observed and simulated seismic data. Utilizing automatic differentiation (AD), ADFWI **simplifies the derivation and implementation of Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)**, enhancing the design and evaluation of methodologies. It supports wave propagation in various media, including isotropic acoustic, isotropic elastic, and both vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) and tilted transverse isotropy (TTI) models.

In addition, **ADFWI** provides a comprehensive collection of Objective functions, regularization techniques, optimization algorithms, and deep neural networks. This rich set of tools facilitates researchers in conducting experiments and comparisons, enabling them to explore innovative approaches and refine their methodologies effectively.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

To install the Automatic Differentiation-Based Full Waveform Inversion (ADFWI) framework, please follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites**  
   Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:  
   - **Python 3.8 or higher**: Download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **pip** (Python package installer).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. You can use either `venv` or `conda`. 
   For example, using `conda`:
   ```bash
   conda create --name adfwi-env python=3.8
   conda activate adfwi-env
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**
- Method 1: **Clone the github Repository**
  This method provides the latest version, which may be more suitable for your research:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/liufeng2317/ADFWI.git
    cd ADFWI
    ```
    Then, install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Method 2: Install via pip
  Alternatively, you can directly install ADFWI from PyPI:
  ```bash
    pip install ADFWI-Torch
  ```

4. **Verify the Installation**
  To ensure that ADFWI is installed correctly, run any examples located in the examples folder.

5. **Troubleshooting**
   If you encounter any issues during installation, please check the Issues section of the GitHub repository for potential solutions or to report a new issue.
