# About the project
Scpyce is an SQL based library for building and visualising finite element models.

_For more information on the project structure, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/nicbencini/scpyce/tree/main/docs)_.

# The solver
Sign Convention:
- Positive values represent upward forces
- Negative values represent downward forces
- Clockwise moments are positive moments
- Counter Clockwise moments are negative moments

Units:
- Force: kN
- Moment: KNm
- Distance: m
- Area: m^2
- Density kN/m^3
- Moment of inertia: m^4
- Youngs Modulus: MPa
- Embodied carbon: kgCO2e/m^3
- Coefficient of thermal expansion : 1/c

# Getting started
_For examples on how to use the solver, please refer to the [Examples](https://github.com/nicbencini/scpyce/tree/main/examples)_.
