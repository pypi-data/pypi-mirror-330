# Migration notes

Migration and deprecation notes for tmuxp are here, see {ref}`changelog` as
well.

```{admonition} Welcome on board! 👋
1. 📌 For safety, **always** pin the package
2. 📖 Check the migration notes _(You are here)_
3. 📣 If you feel something got deprecated and it interrupted you - past, present, or future - voice your opinion on the [tracker].

   We want to make tmuxp fun, reliable, and useful for users.

   API changes can be painful.

   If we can do something to draw the sting, we'll do it. We're taking a balanced approach. That's why these notes are here!

   (Please pin the package. 🙏)

## Next release

_Notes on the upcoming release will be added here_

<!-- Maintainers, insert changes / features for the next release here -->

## tmuxp 1.18.0 (2022-10-30)

**Restructuring** (#840)

"Config files" and "configs" are now referred to as workspace files.

Additionally, there's been a major file structure update:

- `cli/utils.py` functions moved to `workspace/finders.py`
- `config.py` split between:

  - `workspace/finders.py`
  - `workspace/freezer.py`
  - `workspace/importers.py`
  - `workspace/validation.py`

- `workspacebuilder.py` split into:

  - `workspace/builder.py`
  - `workspace/freezer.py`

    `config.inline` moved to freezer

Tests:

- `tests/fixtures/{workspacebuilder,workspacefreezer}` -> `tests/fixtures/workspace/{builder,freezer}`
- `tests/test_import_{teamocil,tmuxinator}.py` -> `tests/workspace/test_import_{teamocil,tmuxinator}.py`

## tmuxp 1.17.0 (2022-10-09)

**Completions have changed** (#830)

Completions now use a different tool: [shtab]. See the [completions page] for more information.

If you were using earlier versions of tmuxp (earlier than 1.17.0), you may need to uninstall the old completions, first.
