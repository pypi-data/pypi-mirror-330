# Pi Fan Controller

Raspberry Pi fan controller.

## Description

This repository provides a CLI that can be run on the Raspberry Pi to
monitor the core temperature and start the fan when the temperature reaches
a defined threshold.

To use this code, you'll have to install a fan. The full instructions can be
found on this guide: [Control Your Raspberry Pi Fan (and Temperature) with Python](https://howchoo.com/g/ote2mjkzzta/control-raspberry-pi-fan-temperature-python). However, other ways that enable a fan to be turned on or off with a single pin should work too.
