`EazyML` is a comprehensive Python package designed to simplify machine learning workflows for data scientists, engineers, and developers. With **AutoML capabilities**, eazyml enables automated feature selection, model training, hyperparameter optimization, and cross-validation, all with minimal code. The package trains multiple models in the background, ranks them by performance metrics, and recommends the best model for your use case.

### Features
- **Global Feature Importance**: Get insights into the most impactful features in your dataset.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Enhance predictive reliability with confidence scores.

`EazyML` is perfect for users looking to streamline the development of robust and efficient machine learning models.

## Installation
### User installation
The easiest way to install eazyml modeling is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml
```
### Dependencies
Eazyml Augmented Intelligence requires :
- werkzeug,
- unidecode,
- pandas,

## Usage
Initialize and build a predictive model based on the provided dataset and options. 
Perform prediction on the given test data based on model options.

```python
from eazyml_augi import ez_init, ez_augi

# initialize: setup book-keeping, access_key if required 
_ = ez_init()

ez_build_model(
            df='train_dataframe'
            options={
                "model_type": "predictive",
                "accelerate": "yes",
                "outcome": "target",
                "remove_dependent": "no",
                "derive_numeric": "yes",
                "derive_text": "no",
                "phrases": {"*": []},
                "text_types": {"*": ["sentiments"]},
                "expressions": []
            }
    )
ez_predict(
            test_data ='test_dataframe'
            options={
                "extra_info": {
                },
                "model": "Specified model to be used for prediction",
                "outcome": "target",
            }
    )

```
