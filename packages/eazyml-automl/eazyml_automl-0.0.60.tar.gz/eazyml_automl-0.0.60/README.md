`eazyml-automl` is a comprehensive python package designed to simplify machine learning workflows for data scientists, engineers, and developers. With **AutoML capabilities**, EazyML enables automated feature selection, model training, hyperparameter optimization, and cross-validation, all with minimal code. The package trains multiple models in the background, ranks them by performance metrics, and recommends the best model for your use case.

### Features
- **Global Feature Importance**: Get insights into the most impactful features in your dataset.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Enhance predictive reliability with confidence scores.

`eazyml-automl` is perfect for users looking to streamline the development of robust and efficient machine learning models.

## Installation
### User installation
The easiest way to install EazyML modeling is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-automl
```
### Dependencies
EazyML Modeling requires :
- werkzeug,
- unidecode,
- pandas,
- scikit-learn,
- nltk,
- pyyaml,
- requests

## Usage
Initialize and build a predictive model based on the provided dataset and options. 
Perform prediction on the given test data based on model options.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pickle
from eazyml import ez_init, ez_build_model, ez_predict

# Initialize the EazyML library with the access key.
_ = ez_init()

# Load the training data (make sure the file path is correct).
train_file_path = "path_to_your_training_data.csv"  # Replace with the correct file path
train_data = pd.read_csv(train_file_path)

# Define the outcome (target variable) for the model
outcome = "target"  # Replace with your actual target variable name

# Set the options for building the model
build_options = {"model_type": "predictive"}

# Call the eazyml function to build the model
build_response = ez_build_model(train_data, outcome, options=build_options)

# build_response is a dictionary. Note: Do not print/view the response as it contains sensitive or encrypted model information in model_info.
build_response.keys()

# Expected output (this will vary depending on the data and model):            
# dict_keys(['success', 'message', 'model_performance', 'global_importance', 'model_info'])

# Save the response for later use (e.g., for predictions with ez_predict)
build_model_response_path = 'model_response.pkl'
pickle.dump(build_response, open(build_model_response_path, 'wb'))

# Load test data.
test_file_path = "path_to_your_test_data.csv"
test_data = pd.read_csv(test_file_path)

# Load output from ez_build_model. This should be the pickle file where model information is stored.
build_model_response_path = 'model_response.pkl'
build_model_response = pickle.load(open(build_model_response_path, 'rb'))
model_info = build_model_response["model_info"]

# Choose the model to use for prediction from the available performance options in the response.
pred_options = {"model": "Random Forest with Information Gain"}

# Call the eazyml function to predict
pred_response = ez_predict(test_data, model_info, options=pred_options)

# Check the keys of the prediction response. It will be a dictionary.
pred_response.keys()

# Example Output Keys(this will vary depending on your model and data):
# dict_keys(['success', 'message', 'pred_df'])

```
