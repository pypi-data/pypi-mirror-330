## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Wait! Before installing `tsticker`, ensure that your computer meets the following requirements:

- [install ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

- [install ImageMagick](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.12/guide/install.html)

## Installing `tsticker`

The recommended way to install `tsticker` is through `pipx` for isolated environments:

```bash
pipx install tsticker
```

If `pipx` is not installed, install it with the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

If you want to upgrade `tsticker` to the latest version, use the following command:

```bash
pipx upgrade tsticker
```

## ðŸ”‘ Login with Telegram

We need create a bot as a bridge to manage stickers.

Remember the bot can **only** **auto** manage stickers **created by the bot itself**, once you lost your bot, you can
only manage stickers manually.

To create and manage stickers with `tsticker`, you need a **Telegram Bot Token**. Follow these steps:

1. Open Telegram and search for the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) bot.
2. Start a conversation with BotFather and send the command `/newbot`.
3. Follow the instructions to create your bot and acquire the bot token.

The bot token provided by BotFather will be used as your `BotToken`.

Win + R, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open the command prompt. Run the following command to login

Replace `<token>` with your Telegram bot token and `<user>` with your Telegram user ID (you can get your user ID
from [getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot) by sending `/my_id`).

```bash
tsticker login -t <token> -u <user>
```

We use https://pypi.org/project/keyring/ to manage your tokens, which may require additional steps. If you encounter
problems, refer to: https://github.com/jaraco/keyring

## Adding or Removing Stickers

Just put your images in the `<pack>/stickers` directory and run `tsticker push` to override your cloud sticker pack with
the local sticker pack. We support almost all image formats, including `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `webm`, and
`mov` and so on.

Please don't operate lots of stickers at once time, if there is any error, it will break your workflow, but you can
use `tsticker sync` to recover.

```bash
tsticker push
```

even there are auto-resize and auto-convert, there still have some bad input such as too large image, too long video, so
be careful.

The name of the sticker file can be some direct emoji(like `ðŸ˜„someðŸ§‘` ), or you can fill in the name freely, and we will
look for the most similar
emoji!
