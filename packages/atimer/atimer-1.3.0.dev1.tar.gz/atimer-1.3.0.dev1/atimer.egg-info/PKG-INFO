`atimer` library implements asynchronous timer Python coroutine based on
POSIX timers. The coroutine can be used with Python `asyncio
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ module API.

The main features of the timer, implemented by the library, are

- expires at regular intervals
- allows to track number of expirations if a long running task causes
  overrun
- starts synchronized with system clock at the edge of an interval
- measures time while system is suspended

The `atimer` library is licensed under terms of GPL license, version 3, see
