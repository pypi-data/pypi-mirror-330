3. **Shared Goals:**
   - The scientific objectives of the major projects, such as lunar and planetary exploration, are aligned with advancing global scientific knowledge and technological capabilities [1, 3].

4. **Data Sharing:**
   - Data sharing is a critical aspect of international collaboration, ensuring that the scientific community can benefit from the findings of these missions [1, 3].

## Technological and Operational Constraints

### NASA
NASA's 2024 budget cuts, particularly in the Planetary Science and Space Technology directorates, may impact the development of new technologies and the readiness of future missions. The significant reduction in funding for the Mars Sample Return mission and the indefinite delay of the VERITAS Venus mission highlight the financial and political challenges faced by ambitious planetary science projects [1]. The agency must carefully manage these constraints to ensure the continued success of its major initiatives.

### ESA
ESA's 2024 budget, while showing a steady increase, may still face constraints in specific areas. The agency's focus on space situational awareness and the Galileo navigation system requires advanced technologies and significant resources. The development of these systems may be impacted by budget limitations and the need to balance multiple priorities [2, 3]. However, ESA's commitment to international collaboration and data sharing can help mitigate some of these constraints.

### CNSA
CNSA's 2024-2050 plan is ambitious and may face technological and operational challenges. The development of advanced rockets like the Long March 10 and Long March 9, with a focus on reusability, is a significant technological challenge. The 2030 crewed lunar landing mission and the establishment of the ILRS require advanced life support systems, reliable transportation, and robust communication infrastructure [3]. The agency must also manage the complexities of international collaboration and ensure the security and reliability of its systems.

### Patterns and Trends

1. **Budget Constraints:**
   - Budget constraints are a common challenge for all three agencies, requiring careful resource management and strategic planning [1, 2, 3].

2. **Technological Challenges:**
   - Each agency faces unique technological challenges, from developing advanced rockets to ensuring the reliability of space situational awareness systems [1, 2, 3].

3. **Operational Complexities:**
   - The operational complexities of crewed missions and sample return missions require advanced planning and coordination [1, 3].

4. **International Collaboration:**
   - International collaboration can help mitigate some of the technological and operational challenges by sharing resources and expertise [1, 3].

## Historical Data and Trends

### NASA
NASA's budget has seen significant fluctuations over the decades. In 1969, NASA's budget was 4.5% of the Federal budget, but it has since decreased to less than 0.5% in 2016 [2]. The 2024 budget, while lower than the 2023 enacted budget, is still higher than the 2016 budget. This trend highlights the ongoing challenge of securing sufficient funding for ambitious space exploration projects. Despite these challenges, NASA has continued to achieve significant milestones, such as the development and launch of the Space Launch System (SLS), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and the Red Dragon Mission to Mars in 2018 [2].

### ESA
ESA's budget has shown a steady increase from 2015 to 2024, reflecting a growing commitment to space exploration and related activities [1]. The agency's focus on scientific research, Earth observation, and technology development has remained consistent
