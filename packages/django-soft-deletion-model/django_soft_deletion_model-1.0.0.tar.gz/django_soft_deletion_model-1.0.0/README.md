# Django Soft Deletion üöÄ

**Django Soft Deletion** is a **Django-based library** that enables **soft deletion** by using a `deleted_at` timestamp instead of permanently removing records. This allows you to mark objects as deleted while keeping them in the database.

## üìå Features
‚úÖ **Soft Delete Models** ‚Äì Records are hidden, not deleted.  
‚úÖ **Custom QuerySet** ‚Äì Easily filter active and deleted records.  
‚úÖ **Works with Django ORM** ‚Äì No need for major changes in your models.  
‚úÖ **Cascade Soft Delete Support** ‚Äì Automatically soft deletes related objects.  
‚úÖ **Signal Support** ‚Äì Pre and post soft delete signals included.

## üîß Usage

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Add `SoftDeleteModel` to Your Models**
Extend `SoftDeleteModel` in your models to enable soft deletion:

```python
from soft_deletion.models import SoftDeleteModel

class MyModel(SoftDeleteModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Soft Delete an Object**

Instead of permanently deleting an object, **soft delete it**:

```python
obj = MyModel.objects.get(id=1)
obj.soft_delete()
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Query Active or Deleted Objects**

Use the built-in **queryset filters**:

```python
# Get only active (non-deleted) records
MyModel.objects.active()

# Get only soft-deleted records
MyModel.objects.deleted()
```

## ‚ö° Soft Delete Behavior with Foreign Keys

`django-soft-deletion` respects Django's `on_delete` behavior.

```python
class RelatedModel(SoftDeleteModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class MyModel(SoftDeleteModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    related = models.ForeignKey(RelatedModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

- **`on_delete=models.CASCADE`** ‚Üí Related objects are **also soft deleted**.  
- **`on_delete=models.SET_NULL`** ‚Üí The foreign key is **set to NULL** when soft deleting.  
- **`on_delete=models.PROTECT`** ‚Üí Prevents soft deletion if related objects exist.  

---

## üìú Soft Delete Signals

You can **hook into soft delete events** using signals:

```python
from soft_deletion.signals import pre_soft_delete, post_soft_delete

def pre_delete_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"About to soft delete: {instance}")

pre_soft_delete.connect(pre_delete_handler, sender=MyModel)
```

## ‚úÖ Running Tests

To ensure everything works correctly, run:

```bash
pytest
```
Or using Django's test framework:

```bash
python manage.py test
```
