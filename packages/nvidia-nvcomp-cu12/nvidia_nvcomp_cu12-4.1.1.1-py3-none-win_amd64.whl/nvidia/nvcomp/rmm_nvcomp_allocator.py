"""Custom allocator implementation for using RMM memory resources with nvcomp.

It is legal to import this module without RMM installed. However, using
rmm_nvcomp_allocator will raise an error at runtime in that case.
Due to implementation constraints, the same is true for cupy, which is also
a runtime dependency of rmm_nvcomp_allocator."""
