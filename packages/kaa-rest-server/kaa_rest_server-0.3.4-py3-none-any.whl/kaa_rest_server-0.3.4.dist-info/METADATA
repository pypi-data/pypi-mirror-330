# Kaa REST Server

A very simple python server framework for REST applications.

## Install

```console
pip install kaa-rest-server
```

## [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) - kaa.json

**kaa.json**: Specifies server handling.

```json
{
  "name": "My Server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "server": "server.MyServer",
  "debug": false,
  "enableCors": false,
  "developmentPolling": {
    "enabled": true,
    "intervalSeconds": 1,
    "include": [".", "src", "*.py"],
    "exclude": ["docs", "tests", "__pycache__", "*.md"]
  }
}
```

See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

### Definitions (deprecated)

See [Legacy Documentation](docs/legacy.md)

## Main classes

### server.py

Initializes Kaa for each http request:

```python
from kaa import KaaServer


class MyServer(KaaServer):

    def register_resources(self):
        self.kaa.register_resources("resources", "AppResources")
```

### resources.py

This class define your resources (or routes):

```python
from kaa import GET, PATH, Resources, Response, Status


class AppResources(Resources):

    @GET
    @PATH("/")
    def basic_resource(self, **params):
        return Response(Status.OK).json({
            "message": "your response"
        })
```

## Starting server

**Static mode** (serve): Starts Kaa server in static mode. Every code change
needs restart server manually.

```console
kaa serve
```

**Development mode** (dev): Start server that auto restarts on every code change.

```console
kaa dev
```

## Custom host and port

By default host is localhost and port is 5321.

You can change them adding host and port on kaa.json file:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 5111,
  // ...
}
```

Or in command line:

```console
kaa serve host:port
```
