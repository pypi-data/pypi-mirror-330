# ARIA Policy Implementation

## Overview

ARIA's policy system provides a flexible and robust framework for managing AI participation in software projects. This document details the technical implementation of the policy system, which supports two distinct policy formats: capability-based (for testing) and model-based (for production).

## Policy Formats

### Capability-Based Format
Designed primarily for testing and human readability:
- Focus on specific AI capabilities
- Clear conditions and restrictions
- Simplified structure for non-technical users
- Easier to understand and validate

### Model-Based Format
Designed for production environments:
- Integration with code repositories
- Path-specific rules
- Predefined models with default settings
- More granular control over permissions

## Core Components

### AIAction Enum
Defines possible AI interactions with the codebase:
- `GENERATE`: Create new code
- `MODIFY`: Change existing code
- `SUGGEST`: Propose changes
- `REVIEW`: Analyze code
- `EXECUTE`: Run code or commands

### AIPermission Class
Represents permission settings for specific actions:
- Action type
- Requirements (e.g., human review)
- Constraints (e.g., path patterns)

### PolicyModel Enum
Predefined participation models:
- `GUARDIAN`: Complete restriction
- `OBSERVER`: Analysis and review only
- `ASSISTANT`: Suggestions with human review
- `COLLABORATOR`: Area-specific permissions
- `PARTNER`: Maximum participation with guardrails

### PathPolicy Class
Manages path-specific rules:
- Path patterns
- Allowed actions
- Required validations
- Inheritance rules

### AIPolicy Class
Overall policy management:
- Policy loading/saving
- Permission validation
- Model enforcement
- Path matching
- Support for multiple policy formats

### PolicyManager Class
Central policy coordination:
- Policy configuration
- Permission checking
- Rule inheritance
- Validation pipeline

## Implementation Details

### Capability-Based Configuration
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
name: test_policy
description: A comprehensive test policy
capabilities:
  - name: code_generation
    description: Generate code based on user requirements
    allowed: true
    conditions:
      - Must include appropriate comments.
      - Must follow project coding standards.
restrictions:
  - Must not retain user data beyond the session.
  - Must inform users about limitations.
```

### Model-Based Configuration
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
name: production_policy
model: ASSISTANT
defaults:
  allow:
    - review
    - suggest
  require:
    - human_review
paths:
  'src/**/*.py':
    allow:
      - generate
      - modify
    require:
      - unit_tests
  'docs/**':
    allow:
      - generate
      - format
```

### Permission Checking
1. Detect policy format (capability or model-based)
2. For model-based:
   - Path matching using glob patterns
   - Model-based permission inheritance
   - Explicit permission validation
   - Requirement verification
3. For capability-based:
   - Capability validation
   - Condition checking
   - Restriction enforcement

### Validation Pipeline
1. Common validation:
   - Required fields check
   - Type validation
2. Format-specific validation:
   - Capability-based validation
   - Model-based validation
3. Strict validation (optional):
   - Enhanced quality checks
   - Detailed warnings
4. Result compilation

### Integration Points
- CI/CD hooks
- IDE plugins
- Git pre-commit hooks
- Policy documentation generation

## Best Practices

### Policy Format Selection
1. Use capability-based format for:
   - Testing and development
   - Non-technical stakeholders
   - Simple use cases
2. Use model-based format for:
   - Production environments
   - Complex codebases
   - Integration with CI/CD

### Policy Definition
1. Start with a restrictive model
2. Use explicit permissions
3. Define clear path patterns
4. Document requirements

### Policy Management
1. Regular policy reviews
2. Version control integration
3. Automated validation
4. Clear documentation

## Future Enhancements
1. Enhanced policy analytics
2. Machine learning-based policy recommendations
3. Automated policy testing
4. Integration with more development tools
5. Policy visualization tools
