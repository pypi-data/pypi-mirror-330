## Overview

**Decent-DP** is a cutting-edge PyTorch extension designed to simplify and accelerate decentralized data parallel training. As the official implementation of the paper **"From Promise to Practice: Realizing High-performance Decentralized Training"** (accepted at ICLR 2025), Decent-DP empowers you to scale multi-worker training efficientlyâ€”eliminating centralized bottlenecks and streamlining your deep learning pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**  
  Efficiently distributes training across multiple workers without relying on a central coordinator.

- **Seamless PyTorch Integration**  
  Easily plug into your existing PyTorch codebase with minimal modifications.

- **High-Performance**  
  Optimized for speed and scalability based on state-of-the-art research.

- **Flexible and Extensible**  
  Supports various algorithmic schemas to suit different training scenarios and model architectures.

## Quickstart

Here is a pseudocode exmaple of how to use Decent-DP to train a model

```python

  import torch.distributed as dist
  from decent_dp.ddp import DecentralizedDataParallel as DecentDP

  # Initialize process group
  dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'gloo', init_method='env://')

  # Initialize model (move to device before wrapping with DecentDP)
  model = ...
  model = model.to(device)

  # Wrap model with DecentDP
  model = DecentDP(model,
                    # optimizer constructor function which takes List[Tuple[str, Tensor]] as input and returns an optimizer
                    # examples could be found in `decent_dp.optim` module
                    optim_fn=<optimizer constructor function>,
                    # lr scheduler constructor function which takes an optimizer as input and returns a lr scheduler.
                    # None if no lr scheduler is used
                    # examples could be found in `decent_dp.optim` module
                    lr_scheduler_fn=<lr scheduler constructor function>,
                    # topology of the network which is a string
                    # supported topologies are 'ring', 'exp', 'complete', 'alternating-exp-ring'
                    # see Section `Communication topology` for more details
                    topology=<topology>)
  
  # Training loop
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      model.train()
      for batch in data_loader:
          loss = model(batch)
          model.zero_grad()
          loss.backward()
          # no need for optimizer.step() as it is handled by DecentDP

      model.eval()
      for batch in val_data_loader:
          with torch.no_grad():
              loss = model(batch)
```

Launch the script on multiple processes/nodes using [`torchrun`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html).
