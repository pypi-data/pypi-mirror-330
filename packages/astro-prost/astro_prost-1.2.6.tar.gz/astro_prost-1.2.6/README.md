# Prost: Probabilistic Host Galaxy Association
## Prost is a code for rapidly associating transients with their host galaxies. 
The code calculates the posterior probability that each galaxy in a search region is the true host galaxy, by considering
the transient's fractional offset, redshift (or the prior for the survey), and brightness. The code can query from the following catalogs:
* <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1403D">GLADE+</a>  
* <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..168D">DECaLS (DR9 and DR10)</a>
* <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161205560C">PanSTARRS (DR1 and DR2)</a>

The code also estimates the posterior probability that the true host lies outside of the search cone or is missing from the search catalog. The priors and likelihoods for each property can be customized according to the transient survey.
