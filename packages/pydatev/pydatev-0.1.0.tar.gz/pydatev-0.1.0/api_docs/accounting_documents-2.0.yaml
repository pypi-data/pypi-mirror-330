      summary: Returns a list of clients that are accessible for the user.
      description: >-
        Returns a list of all clients to which the user has access. The user is
        only familiar with the client name, the client number, and the
        consultant number. For all subsequent requests concerning data transfer
        to DATEV, the ID of the client is necessary. The ID is a technical
        object for the communication between the third-party solution and the
        DATEV data center. The ID is not to be displayed to the end user. 


        **Please note:** Data transfer to the DATEV data center is only possible
        if the user has access to the client. The third-party solution must
        ensure this by checking that the client number and consultant number
        exists in the list of clients.


        **Example: The user has access to one client**

            [{
                "client_number": 1,
                "consultant_number": 455148,

                "name": "Muster GmbH 1"
            }]

            

            
        **Example: The user has access to two clients** 
            
            
            [{
                "client_number":1,

        Returns a list of basic data about a given client. With this
        information, the third-party solution can check whether the
        configuration of the client is suitable and prepared for data transfer:
        a client for the application Belege online and a matching fiscal year
        for the editing form \"extended\" , for the application
        Rechnungseingangsbuch online for transferring accounts payable data, for
        the application Rechnungsausgangsbuch online for transferring accounts
        receivable data, and/or for the application Kassenbuch online for
        transferring cash entries are necessary.   


        **Please note:** If a matching fiscal year is not present, but there is
        a previous fiscal year that meets certain requirements, DATEV will
        automatically generate the subsequent matching fiscal year. This will be
        done within the operation \"create a data transfer (dxso-job)\" . This
        function is not available for the application Kassenbuch online.

        Returns a list of document types for a given client. The user is
        normally only familiar with the name of the document type. The document
        type is determined by the properties category and
        debit_credit_identifier. Further processing in DATEV Unternehmen online
        depends on these properties. For example, a document type with the
        category “invoice_received” is processed as an incoming invoice. 


        The document type in DATEV applications is called “Belegtyp”. A client
        can have a lot of different document types. There are document types
        with special restrictions – document types with the category
        “personnel_documents” and “travel_expense_documents”. This means that
        the user’s DATEV authentication method needs to be configured with
        special rights.


        **Please note:** If the returned list is empty then the client has no
        document types. Normally, a client has at least four document types.

      summary: Transfers a document
      description: >
        A new accounting document will be transferred to Belege online in DATEV
        Unternehmen online. Each accounting document is transferred in a
        multipart object as a single file with optional metadata (document type
        and note). The content-type indicated in the multipart object has to
        correspond to the file. The accepted content-types and the accepted file
        size are determined by Belege online. Exception: ZIP files are not
        supported.


        It is recommended that the user chooses the document type for each
        accounting document, as the document type affects further processing by
        DATEV. The chosen document type has to be existent at the given client.
        Please check the list of document types for a given client. The user
        should also have the possibility to choose “no document type”. 


        If the value of the document_type is empty, then the parameter will be
        ignored and will not be returned in the response. In this case, and if
        the parameter document_type is not used, the term “ohne Belegtyp”
        (without document type) is displayed in the DATEV applications.


        **Please note:** 

        It is recommended that file names are encoded in UTF8. Unicode
        characters have to be precomposed characters; in other words, each
        special character, such as an umlaut (ä, ü, ö), has to be a single code
        point. Decomposed characters are not supported. This applies to both the
        file name and the metadata. There exists a white list for signs that may
        be used in file names. Unallowed signs will be replaced by underscore.

        These signs may be used: Space &()+-._
        0-9A-Za-zÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúûüýþÿ


        Large files require more storage space and can slow down load times
        within DATEV Unternehmen online and the DATEV Rechnungswesen-Programm.
        We recommend that the user is informed whenever the file size exceeds
        500 kB.

      summary: Transfers a document with an ID
      description: >
        A new accounting document with the ID of the document in the format of a
        GUID will be transferred to Belege online in DATEV Unternehmen online.


        **Please note:** If the ID of the document already exists in Belege
        online, then the import will be aborted with an error.


        Each accounting document is transferred in a multipart object as a
        single file with optional metadata (document type and note). The
        content-type indicated in the multipart object has to correspond to the
        file. The accepted content-types and the accepted file size are
        determined by Belege online. Exception: ZIP files are not supported.


        It is recommended that the user chooses the document type for each
        accounting document, as the document type affects further processing by
        DATEV. The chosen document type has to be existent at the given client.
        Please check the list of document types for a given client. The user
        should also have the possibility to choose “no document type”.


        If the value of document_type is empty, then the parameter will be
        ignored and will not be returned in the response. In this case, and if
        the parameter document_type is not used, the term “ohne Belegtyp”
        (without document type) is displayed in the DATEV applications.


        **Please note:** 

        It is recommended that file names are encoded in UTF8. Unicode
        characters have to be precomposed characters; in other words, each
        special character, such as an umlaut (ä, ü, ö), has to be a single code
        point. Decomposed characters are not supported. This applies to both the
        file name and the metadata. There exists a white list for signs that may
        be used in file names. Unallowed signs will be replaced by underscore.

        These signs may be used: Space &()+-._
        0-9A-Za-zÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúûüýþÿ  


        Large files require more storage space and can slow down load times
        within DATEV Unternehmen online and the DATEV Rechnungswesen-Programm.
        We recommend that the user is informed whenever the file size exceeds
        500 kB.

        New accounting documents will be transferred to Belege online in DATEV
        Unternehmen online. The documents become stapled in the incoming order.


        Each accounting document is transferred in a multipart object as a
        single file. Only one optional metadata (document type and note) is
        allowed. The content-type indicated in the multipart object has to
        correspond to the file. The accepted content-types and the accepted file
        size are determined by Belege online. Exception: ZIP files are not
        supported.


        It is recommended that the user chooses one document type for all
        accounting documents, as the document type affects further processing by
        DATEV. The chosen document type has to be existent at the given client.
        Please check the list of document types for a given client. The user
        should also have the possibility to choose “no document type”.


        If the value of document_type is empty, then the parameter will be
        ignored and will not be returned in the response. In this case, and if
        the parameter document_type is not used, the term “ohne Belegtyp”
        (without document type) is displayed in the DATEV applications.


        **Please note:** 

        It is recommended that file names are encoded in UTF8. Unicode
        characters have to be precomposed characters; in other words, each
        special character, such as an umlaut (ä, ü, ö), has to be a single code
        point. Decomposed characters are not supported. This applies to both the
        file name and the metadata. There exists a white list for signs that may
        be used in file names. Unallowed signs will be replaced by underscore.

        These signs may be used: Space &()+-._
        0-9A-Za-zÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúûüýþÿ


        Large files require more storage space and can slow down load times
        within DATEV Unternehmen online and the DATEV Rechnungswesen-Programm.
        We recommend that the user is informed whenever the file size exceeds
        500 kB.
