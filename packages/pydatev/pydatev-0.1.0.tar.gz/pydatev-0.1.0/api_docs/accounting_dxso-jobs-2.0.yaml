        A data transfer (dxso-job) is created and the ID for this data transfer
        (dxso-job) is returned if the requirements are fulfilled. 


        The transferred data has to be in the format DATEV XML-Schnittstelle
        online version 4.0 or higher. The transferred data can only be processed
        if the configuration of the client is suitable for data processing: a
        client for the application Belege online in DATEV Unternehmen online and
        a matching fiscal year for the editing form "extended" , for the
        application Rechnungseingangsbuch online for transferring accounts
        payable data, for the application Rechnungsausgangsbuch online for
        transferring accounts receivable data, and/or for the application
        Kassenbuch online for transferring cash entries are necessary. 


        Therefore, it is recommended to determine the data by creating the data
        transfer and set the parameters import_type (type of data) and
        accounting_month. If the parameters are set and a matching fiscal year
        is not present, but there is a previous fiscal year that meets certain
        requirements, DATEV will automatically generate the subsequent matching
        fiscal year. This function is not available for the application
        Kassenbuch online.


        It is recommended that the transferred data is in the format **DATEV
        LedgerImport-Package**: <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Data type</th>
        <th>Extension in document.xml of DATEV LedgerImport-Packages</th>
        <th>Element in the data file of the DATEV LedgerImport-Packages</th>

         <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Data type</th> <th>Extension in document.xml of DATEV Invoice-Packages</th> <th>Element in the data file of the DATEV Invoice-Packages</th> <th>Value for API parameter 'import_type'</th> <th>Automatic generation of the next fiscal year</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Incoming invoices</td> <td>xsi:type'invoice' with property 'Incoming' as 'InvoiceType'</td> <td>invoice</td> <td>'import_type': 'accountsPayableLedgerImport'</td> <td>possible </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Outgoing invoices</td> <td>xsi:type='invoice' with property 'Outgoing' as 'InvoiceType' </td> <td>invoice</td> <td>'import_type': 'accountsReceivableLedgerImport'</td> <td>possible</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 


        **Notes:**

        The third-party solution ensures that for each variant of data (accounts
        payable data, accounts receivable data, and cash entries) and for each
        accounting period/month an own data transfer (dxso-job) is created. 


        The "content type" header must be "application/json". 


        **Remember:** When working with Kassenbuch online, the cash data must be
        supplied in the correct order so as to avoid a negative cash balance.
        Data transfers (dxso-job) cannot be processed in parallel. Kassenbuch
        online cannot be edited during import and vice versa. A new data
        transfer (dxso-job) can only be started when the previous data transfer
        (dxso-job) for cash data has been completed.


        **Example: DATEV accountsReceivableLedgerImport-Package**
         

        ```json

        POST /accounting/v1/clients/{client-id}/dxso-jobs/ HTTP/1.1

        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

        Authorization: bearer <access_token>

        Content-Length: <length>

        Host: <resourceServer>


        {

        "import_type":"accountsReceivableLedgerImport",

        "accounting_month":"2017-01"

        }

        ```
         

        The third-party solution has to analyze the returned information. The
        name of the correct ledger folder is part of the information in
        document.xml of the DATEV accountsReceivableLedgerImport-Package.



        **Example: DATEV accountsPayableLedgerImport-Package**


        ```json

        POST /accounting/v1/clients/{client-id}/dxso-jobs/ HTTP/1.1

        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

        Authorization: bearer <access_token>

        Content-Length: <length>

        Host: <resourceServer>


        {

        "import_type":"accountsPayableLedgerImport",

        "accounting_month":"2017-01"

        }

        ```
         

        The third-party solution has to analyze the returned information. The
        name of the correct ledger folder is part of the information in
        document.xml of the DATEV accountsPayableLedgerImport-Package.


        **Example: DATEV cashLedgerImport-Package**


        ```json

        POST /accounting/v1/clients/{client-id}/dxso-jobs/

        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

        Authorization: bearer <access_token>

        Content-Length: <length>

        Host: <resourceServer>


        {

        "import_type":"cashLedgerImport",

        "accounting_month":"2017-01"

        }

        ```


        The third-party solution has to analyze the returned information. The
        name of the correct cash ledger is part of the information in
        document.xml of the DATEV cashLedgerImport-Package.


        **Example: DATEV invoice-Package with incoming invoices to one period**


        ```json

        POST /accounting/v1/clients/{client-id}/dxso-jobs/

        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

        Authorization: bearer <access_token>

        Content-Length: <length>

        Host: <resourceServer>


        {

        "import_type":"accountsPayableLedgerImport",

        "accounting_month":"2017-01"

        }

        ```
         
        The third-party solution has to analyze the returned information. Please
        note that in this case the name of the ledger folder is not a part of
        the information in document.xml.


        **Example: Creation of a data transfer (dxso-jobs) without parameters**


        ```json

        POST /accounting/v1/clients/{client-id}/dxso-jobs/

        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

        Authorization: bearer <access_token>

        Content-Length: <length>

        Host: <resourceServer>


        {


        }

        ```
         
        The third-party solution has to check and receive further information on
        its own (fiscal year, account_length, ledger_folder_names, etc.). During
        the processing of invoice data, the automatic generation of the
        subsequent fiscal year will also be performed by the DATEV solution.

        Attaches files to a data transfer (dxso-job). Each file is transferred
        as a single file and not as a ZIP file as it is described in the
        documentation of DATEV XML-Schnittstelle online. The third-party
        solution ensures that only correctly validated data are transferred to
        the DATEV data center. The data format and the file size of the files
        have to be supported by DATEV. 


        The files (including the file information) need to be transferred as
        data type \"multipart/form-data\" to ensure all details are
        transferred. 


        **Please note:** It is recommended that file names be encoded in UTF8.
        Unicode characters have to be precomposed characters; that is, each
        special character, such as an umlaut ( &auml;, &uuml;, &ouml;), has to
        be one single code point. Decomposed characters are not supported. There
        exists a white list for signs that may be used in file names. Unallowed
        signs will be replaced by underscore. These signs may be used: Space
        &()+-._

        long as the data transfer (dxso-job) has not been finalized. A data
        transfer (dxso-job) that has not yet been finalized has the status 0.
        All data concerning the cancelled data transfer (dxso-job) is deleted
        after cancellation.  


        After deleting a data transfer (dxso-job), no file uploads and no
        protocol entry requests are possible because all data and protocol
        entries have been removed for this data transfer (dxso-job).


        Possible reasons for the cancellation of a data transfer (dxso-job):


        - The information returned after creating a data transfer (dxso-job) is
        not suitable for the configuration of the third-party solution.

        - The validation of the data in accordance to the DATEV
        XML-Schnittstelle online has returned an error.

        - The user has cancelled the data transfer (dxso-job).

      description: >
        The processing of a data transfer (dxso-job) has to be checked as it is
        executed asynchronously. To do this, the third-party solution should
        provide the protocol entries (from Belege online in DATEV Unternehmen
        online) to the user. The protocol entries contain detailed information
        about the processing in DATEV Unternehmen online. The entries are kept
        only a limited time (about two months) in DATEV Unternehmen online, so
        the third-party solution has to store this information. The protocol
        entries are prepared for the display for the user. DATEV will change the
        messages from time to time.


        **Note:** Data transfers (dxso-jobs) are processed asynchronously.


        **Example: One protocol entry of a data transfer:** 

        ```json
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
