    Configuration for getaddrinfo DNS resolver. This resolver will use the
    system's getaddrinfo() function to resolve hosts. .. attention::   This
    resolver uses a single background thread to do resolutions. As such, it is
    not currently   advised for use in situations requiring a high resolution
    rate. A thread pool can be added   in the future if needed. .. attention::
    Resolutions currently use a hard coded TTL of 60s because the getaddrinfo()
    API does not   provide the actual TTL. Configuration for this can be added
    in the future if needed.
