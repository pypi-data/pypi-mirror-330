    Google's `RE2 <https://github.com/google/re2>`_ regex engine. The regex
    string must adhere to the documented `syntax
    <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>`_. The engine is designed to
    complete execution in linear time as well as limit the amount of memory
    used. Envoy emits two stats for tracking the program size of regexes: the
    histogram ``re2.program_size``, which records the program size, and the
    counter ``re2.exceeded_warn_level``, which is incremented each time the
    program size exceeds the warn level threshold.
