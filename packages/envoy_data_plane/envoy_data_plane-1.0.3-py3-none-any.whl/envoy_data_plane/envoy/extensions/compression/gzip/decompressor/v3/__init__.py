    Value from 9 to 15 that represents the base two logarithmic of the
    decompressor's window size. The decompression window size needs to be equal
    or larger than the compression window size. The default window size is 15.
    This is so that the decompressor can decompress a response compressed by a
    compressor with any compression window size. For more details about this
    parameter, please refer to `zlib manual
