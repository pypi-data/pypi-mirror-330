    Dictionaries for decompression. Zstd offers dictionary compression, which
    greatly improves efficiency on small files and messages. It is necessary to
    ensure that the dictionary used for decompression is the same as the
    compression dictionary. Multiple dictionaries can be set, and the
    dictionary will be automatically selected for decompression according to
    the dictionary ID in the source content. Please refer to `zstd manual
    <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/programs/zstd.1.md#dictionary-
    builder>`_ to train specific dictionaries for decompression.
