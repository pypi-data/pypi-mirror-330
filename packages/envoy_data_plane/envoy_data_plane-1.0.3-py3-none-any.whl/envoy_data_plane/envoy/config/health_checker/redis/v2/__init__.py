    If set, optionally perform ``EXISTS <key>`` instead of ``PING``. A return
    value from Redis of 0 (does not exist) is considered a passing healthcheck.
    A return value other than 0 is considered a failure. This allows the user
    to mark a Redis instance for maintenance by setting the specified key to
    any value and waiting for traffic to drain.
