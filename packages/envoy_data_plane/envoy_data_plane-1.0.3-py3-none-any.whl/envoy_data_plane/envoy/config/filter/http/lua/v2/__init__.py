    The Lua code that Envoy will execute. This can be a very small script that
    further loads code from disk if desired. Note that if JSON configuration is
    used, the code must be properly escaped. YAML configuration may be easier
    to read since YAML supports multi-line strings so complex scripts can be
    easily expressed inline in the configuration.
