    The idle timeout for the connection. The idle timeout is defined as the
    period in which the connection is not associated with a downstream
    connection. When the idle timeout is reached, the connection will be
    closed. If not set, the default idle timeout is 10 minutes. To disable idle
    timeouts, explicitly set this to 0. .. warning::   Disabling this timeout
    has a highly likelihood of yielding connection leaks due to lost TCP   FIN
    packets, etc.
