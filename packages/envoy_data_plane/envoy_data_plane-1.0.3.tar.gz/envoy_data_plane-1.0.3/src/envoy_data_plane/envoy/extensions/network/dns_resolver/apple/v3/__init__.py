    The resolver will avoid the system's heuristics to only return IPv4 or IPv6
    addresses that it considers to be "routable", instead returning all
    possible IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. This setting is ignored if the DNS lookup
    family is set to v4-only or v6-only. This should remain false in the vast
    majority of cases, but may be useful when performing custom filtering of
    addresses, such as with Happy Eyeballs.
