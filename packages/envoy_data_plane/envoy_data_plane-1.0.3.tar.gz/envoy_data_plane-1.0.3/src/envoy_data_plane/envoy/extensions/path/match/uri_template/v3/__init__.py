    If specified, the route is a template match rule meaning that the ``:path``
    header (without the query string) must match the given ``path_template``
    pattern. Path template matching types: * ``*`` : Matches a single path
    component, up to the next path separator: / * ``**`` : Matches zero or more
    path segments. If present, must be the last operator. * ``{name} or
    {name=*}`` :  A named variable matching one path segment up to the next
    path separator: /. * ``{name=videos/*}`` : A named variable matching more
    than one path segment.      The path component matching videos/* is
    captured as the named variable. * ``{name=**}`` : A named variable matching
    zero or more path segments. For example: * ``/videos/*/*/*.m4s`` would
    match ``videos/123414/hls/1080p5000_00001.m4s`` * ``/videos/{file}`` would
    match ``/videos/1080p5000_00001.m4s`` * ``/**.mpd`` would match
    ``/content/123/india/dash/55/manifest.mpd``
