    mmseqspy provides utilities for clustering protein sequences and creating train-test splits
    that respect sequence similarity. It requires MMseqs2 to be installed and in your PATH.
    Features include sequence clustering, cluster-aware train/test splits, k-fold cross-validation,
    and constrained dataset splitting.
