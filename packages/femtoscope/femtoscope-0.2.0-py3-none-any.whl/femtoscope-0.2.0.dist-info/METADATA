The *femtoscope* software was written as part of [Hugo Lévy's PhD thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04789073v1/document) (2021-2024). This Python code can be used to investigate different models of modified gravity within complex geometries on unbounded domains.

## Installation

*femtoscope* can be either installed from PyPI
```console
pip install femtoscope
```
or from conda-forge
```console
conda install femtoscope
```

### Generate documentation
The documentation may be generated by running
```console
python -m femtoscope.misc.generate_documentation
cd doc/
```
Alternatively, one can use the CLI Entry Point
```console
generate-femtoscope-docs
cd doc/
```
Note that these two options will generate the documentation at the current directory. Additional information about *femtoscope* can be found in [Hugo Lévy's PhD thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04789073v1/document), chapter 4.

### Run tests

To check the installation, it is recommended to run the tests bundle with
```console
python -m femtoscope.tests.run_tests
```
Alternatively, one can use the CLI Entry Point
```console
run-femtoscope-tests
```

## Getting started

Getting started notebooks are available at https://github.com/onera/femtoscope/tree/main/tutorials.

## Development mode

Clone the *femtoscope* repository https://github.com/onera/femtoscope/ which contains the source files. It is recommended to run *femtoscope* on a dedicated virtual environment. The `femtoscope.yml` file can be used to automate the creation of a conda environment as follows:

1) Create the environment
	```console
	conda env create -f femtoscope.yml
	```
	Note that this process is likely to take several tens of minutes.
2) Activate the new environment
	```console
	conda activate femtoscope
	```
3) Verify that the new environment was installed correctly
	```console
    conda env list
	```
   and make sure femtoscope appears in the list.
   
**note**
The project uses Python >= 3.9

## Main dependencies

- Python >= 3.9
- meshio == 4.4.6 (read & write mesh files)
- numpy < 2 (sfepy is not yet compatible with numpy 2.x)
- pandas >= 1.5.3
- pyevtk (creation of `.vtk` files)
- pyvista (visualization of FEM results)
- scipy
- sfepy >= 2024.3 (FEM engine)
- pdoc >= 14.5.1 (patch against polyfill.io malicious CDN)
- gmsh == 4.11.1 (some features of *femtoscope* are broken in newer versions)
