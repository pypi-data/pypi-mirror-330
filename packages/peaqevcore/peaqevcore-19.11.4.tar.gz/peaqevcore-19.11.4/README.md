> Dear Peaquser,
> 
> After three years of open source in these projects, I am about to set sail on the next leg of my journey.
> I will soon start a job where I will work with adjacent technology, and thus will seize to update the repos with new features.
> This is to not be questioned regarding IP going forward.
> 
> For the time being I want to let the codebases stay online, and will accept pull requests and occasionally do patch updates and bug fixes to > keep the solutions running.
> However, I will not take part in general feature discussions any longer, starting from 2024-11-01.
> 
> If you wish you may fork the projects and create features that you send me as pull requests. That way we can keep the flow going without > my direct interference in the inventions.
> For any usage not covered by the general download by hacs, look towards the license on the repos for guidance. Here's a snapshot of what > the licenses on my code requires: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en
> 
> Thanks for all engagement and happy to have helped a bunch of people with this spare time invention of mine. 
> //Magnus

### :cherries: Sponsorship and prioritized development :cherries:
Peaqev is developed without static funding. If you lack your locale/charger type or have wishes for other specific features that you would like to see prioritized, please consider becoming a [Github sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/elden1337) to bump your desired changes in my backlog.
- In order to flag a ticket, either create a new one or comment on an existing one after you've started your sponsorship. I will then flag the ticket with `sponsored-change` and try to prioritize this going forward
- Becoming a sponsor is not a guarantee that a wish will be created, or a guarantee for a specified resolution time. Peaqev is being developed in my spare time and every feature has to be considered by me before taking it into development
- I may need to reach out for testing, especially if your wish includes implementing new charger types
- Critical bugs discovered of course always triages higher than features
