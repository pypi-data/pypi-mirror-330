Blaeu, creating measurements on RIPE Atlas probes
=================================================

This is a set of `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ programs to start
distributed Internet measurements on the network of `RIPE Atlas
probes <https://atlas.ripe.net/>`__, and to analyze their results.

For installation, you can use usual Python tools, for instance:

::

   pip install blaeu

(On a Debian machine, the prerequitises are packages python3-pip,
python3-openssl, python3-dnspython, and python3-cymruwhois. This is only
if you install manually, otherwise pip will install the dependencies.)

Usage requires a RIPE Atlas API key (which itself requires a RIPE
account), and RIPE Atlas credits. If you don’t have a RIPE account,
`register first <https://access.ripe.net/>`__. Once you have an account,
`create a key <https://atlas.ripe.net/keys/>`__, grant it the right to
``schedule a new measurement``, and

-  use it in environment variable ``ATLASAUTH``
-  or put the key in ``~/.atlas/auth``

If you don’t have Atlas credits, host a probe,or become a
`LIR <https://www.ripe.net/participate/member-support>`__ or ask a
friend.

You can then use the six programs (``-h`` will give you a complete list
of their options):

-  ``blaeu-reach target-IP-address`` (test reachability of the target,
   like ``ping``)
-  ``blaeu-traceroute target-IP-address`` (like ``traceroute``)
-  ``blaeu-resolve name`` (use the DNS to resolve the name)
-  ``blaeu-cert name`` (display the PKIX certificate)
-  ``blaeu-ntp name`` (test NTP)
-  ``blaeu-http name`` (test HTTP, only to anchors)

You have here `some examples of use <EXAMPLES.md>`__. You may also be
interested by `my article at RIPE
Labs <https://labs.ripe.net/Members/stephane_bortzmeyer/creating-ripe-atlas-one-off-measurements-with-blaeu>`__.

Blaeu requires Python 3.

Note that `the old
version <https://github.com/RIPE-Atlas-Community/ripe-atlas-community-contrib>`__
ran on Python 2 but is no longer maintained. (It was `partially
documented at RIPE
Labs <https://labs.ripe.net/Members/stephane_bortzmeyer/using-ripe-atlas-to-debug-network-connectivity-problems>`__.)

Name
----

It comes from the `famous Dutch
cartographer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Blaeu>`__. The logo
of the project comes from his “Theatrum Orbis Terrarum” (see `the
source <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blaeu_1645_-_Livonia_vulgo_Lyefland.jpg>`__).
