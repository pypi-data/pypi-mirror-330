# Test Case Steps

For each test case, the following steps are executed:

- [Test Case Setup](test_case_setup.md)
- [Test Case Teardown](./test_case_teardown.md)
- [Test Case End](./test_case_end.md)

Optionally, the following steps can be executed before the *teardown* step (if test is not *skipped* or *setup* did not *fail*):

- [Test Case Call](./test_case_call.md)

The following sections describe the data structure of each step.
