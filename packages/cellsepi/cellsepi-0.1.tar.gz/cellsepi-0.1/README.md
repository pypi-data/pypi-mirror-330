## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Overview**  
CellSePi is a segmentation pipeline designed for **microscopy images**, featuring an interactive GUI for easier workflow integration. It utilizes **Cellpose** as the core segmentation engine, allowing researchers to efficiently process and analyze cellular images.  

## üìö **Citation**  
Our segmentation and models are powered by [CellPose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) and includes additional tools for correction and analysis.

## üöÄ **Usage**  

**1. Start the application**  
Run the following command to start the GUI:  
```bash
python -m cellsepi
```

**Options**  
- Dark/Light Theme is based on your system and if you change it in options its only for this season.
- Mask and Outline Color are saved in the config file so they are permanent.

**Profiles**  
Our profiles store various parameters **bright-field channel**, **channel prefix**, **mask suffix**, and **diameter**.

**Segmentation**   
To start the segmentation you need to select:
- lif or tif files
- a model  

If the snackbar says ```You have selected an incompatible file for the segmentation model.``` than you selected model is not compatible with the Cellpose segmentation prozess.

While segmentation there are two option:
- **pause**: this pauses the segmentation process (this can take some time if the images are large) and with **resume** button you can continue the segmentation.
- **cancel**: this cancels the segmentation process and sets the mask to the old mask before the segmentation started or deletes them if there was no mask.

**Readout**  
Generates an ```.xlsx``` file containing the extracted fluorescence values.

To open the generated Excel file with your system‚Äôs default spreadsheet program, simply click the "Open Excel" button in the GUI. This will automatically launch the application associated with ```.xlsx``` files on your operating system (e.g., ONLYOFFICE in the example below).

**Drawing Tools**  
To correct wrong segmentation by the model there is the possibility to fix them by hand or if you want you can also draw just the mask without the model to create them to train a new model.
- **Cell ID shifting**: Shifts the mask when a mask got deleted to restore an order without gaps.

All changes are synchronised between the **Drawing Tools** window and the **main** window. So if you delete or draw something in the **Drawing Tools** window you can instantly see it in the **main** window. Furthermore, when you have the **Drawing Tools** window open while segmentation it also updates the drawing window live.
