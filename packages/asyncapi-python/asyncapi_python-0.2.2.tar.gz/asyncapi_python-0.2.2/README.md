Easily generate type-safe and async Python applications from AsyncAPI 3 specifications.

## Features

- [x] Creates `Application` class from [AsyncAPI 3](https://asyncapi.com) specifications, implementing every operation in the file
- [x] Generates typed Python code (messages are generated using [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator))
- [x] Performs dynamic validation of messages with [Pydantic 2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
- [x] Enforces the user code to implement all consumer methods as described by spec
- [x] Provides async code
- [x] Spec parser references other files through absolute or relative paths
- [ ] Spec parser references other files through url
- [x] Supports request-reply pattern
- [x] Supports publish-subscribe pattern
- [ ] AsyncAPI trait support
- [ ] Customizable message encoder/decoder

## Requirements

- `python>=3.9`
- `pydantic>=2`
- `pytz`
- For `codegen` extra
  - `jinja2`
  - `typer`
  - `datamodel-code-generator`
  - `pyyaml`
- For `amqp` extra
  - `aio-pika`

## Installation

For code generation (development env), run:

```bash
pip install asyncapi-python[codegen]
```

For runtime, run:

```bash
pip install asyncapi-python[amqp]
```

You can replace `amqp` with any other supported protocols. For more info, see [Supported Protocols](#supported-protocols--use-cases) section.

## Supported Protocols / Use Cases

Below, you may see the table of protocols and the supported use cases. The tick signs (âœ…) contain links to the examples for each implemented protocol-use case pair, while the hammer signs (ðŸ”¨) contain links to the Issues tracking the progress for protocol-use case pairs. The list of protocols and use cases is expected to increase over the progress of development.

| Use Case   | AMQP                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Pub-Sub    | [âœ… amqp-pub-sub](./examples/amqp-pub-sub)            |
| Work Queue | [âœ… amqp-work-queue](./examples/amqp-work-queue) |
| RPC        | [âœ… amqp-rpc](./examples/amqp-rpc)               |

## Documentation

Although there's no documentation available at the moment, a set of comprehensive examples with comments for each implemented use-case is under the [examples](./examples/) directory.
