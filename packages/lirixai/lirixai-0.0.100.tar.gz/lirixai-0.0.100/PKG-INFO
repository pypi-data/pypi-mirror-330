# Lirix

- Database connection & retrieval
- Embedding storage & retrieval logic
- Integration with a chatbot agent

LirixAI is an open-source Python library designed to simplify the development of agentic and multi-agentic systems. It provides ready-to-use agent implementations by integrating frameworks like Web Search APIs, Supabase databases, and WebRTC, reducing the complexity of setting up backend agenticÂ workflows.

Our framework provides a **simple import and a few lines of code** to get a fully functional chatbot ready with minimal setup.

### Real-World Application
During a previous **hackathon**, we struggled to implement **WebRTC, Streamlit, and Pydantic** together due to the complexity of integration. Our framework eliminates such hurdles by providing direct implementations that work out of the box. 

## Documentation
We are committed to providing **thorough documentation** to ensure seamless adoption. Stay tuned for updates!
