## Quick Start
```bash
pip install llm-apigateway
apigateway 
```
You can enable the local debugging environment with just two simple commands without any other requirements.
## Project Plan
The project plans to use Python as the development language and release it as a pip package so that developers can install and use it easily. The project is still under development, and we hope you can give it a star to support the developers.
## Development Timeline
- ~~Release pip package~~
- Set up a server compatible with the OpenAI API format
- Implement functions to add upstreams and send to upstream interfaces
- Implement functions to modify information and customize responses
- Develop web UI
- Add plugin functionality
- Enable public deployment and access control
- Multi-user support
### Development Log
