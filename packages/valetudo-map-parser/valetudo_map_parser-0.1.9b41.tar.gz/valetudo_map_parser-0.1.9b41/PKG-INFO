### What is it:
❗This is an _unofficial_ project and is not created, maintained, or in any sense linked to [valetudo.cloud](https://valetudo.cloud)

Library to Covert Valetudo's Vacuums Json data in a PIL image.

---

It is developed and used in the [MQTT Vacuum Camera](https://github.com/sca075/mqtt_vacuum_camera).
As python package this code relay on Pythons base and popular pakages such Pillow and Numpy.

This library can be import by simply using ```pip install valetudo_map_parser```.

- It is configured with a dictionary format (on GitHub repo test [sample code](https://github.com/sca075/Python-package-valetudo-map-parser/blob/main/tests/test.py)). 
- It decodes Raw data provided from Rand256.
- It provides functions to decode the json data provided from the vacuums.
- It returns a Pillow PNG image.


We are still working on the final release at current this library will be fully functional with >= v0.1.9. 

Anyone can contribute to make this code batter, with code, docs or simply creating issues if any faced.
In any cases please be aware that "as it is" of course apply if you decide to use it.
