# SCIM Directory Simulator CLI

A command-line tool for simulating and managing a SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) directory. This tool allows you to create and manage users and groups, simulating a real SCIM-compliant identity provider.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap Avinash-Kamath/scim-simulator
brew install scim-sim
```

## Configuration

Before using the tool, you need to set up your SCIM configuration:

```bash
scim-sim config
```

This will prompt you for:
- SCIM Base URL - The endpoint of your SCIM service (e.g., https://api.example.com/scim/v2)
- SCIM Auth Token - Your authentication token

Configuration is stored in `~/.scim_config.json`. You can view your current configuration with:

```bash
scim-sim config
```

## Commands

### User Management

```bash
# Add a new user (generates random user data)
scim-sim add-user

# Remove a user
scim-sim remove-user <user-id>
```

### Group Management

```bash
# Create a new group
scim-sim create-group "Engineering Team"

# Delete a group and its members
scim-sim delete-group <group-id>

# Add user to group
scim-sim add-to-group <user-id> <group-id>

# Remove user from group
scim-sim remove-from-group <user-id> <group-id>
```

### Directory Visualization

```bash
# Show complete directory structure
scim-sim show
```

This will display a tree view of your directory structure, showing all groups and users.

Example output:
```
ðŸ“‚ Directory
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ‘¥ Groups
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Engineering Team â”‚ ID: dirgrp_1234567890123456
