Build an LLM Potato Head. Add a **mouth** (chat), **eyes** (vision/image) and even **ears** (audio)! Fun for all ages!

**Note:** Potato Head currently supports OpenAI compatible apis (more coming soon!) and you can only use **Mouths**. We are actively working on adding more parts to the Potato Head!

</div>


Potato Head was originally built as a sister project to OpsML to help facilitate Prompt standardization and testing. The goal is to provide a simple and easy to use interface with low overhead. Thus, **Potato Head** is written entirely in **Rust** and is exposed via Python bindings to help improve performance and reduce latency of LLM applications when interacting with clients.

Potato Head Prompts are fully compatible with the OpenAI SDK if you prefer to use that instead. Check out the quickstart for more information!
