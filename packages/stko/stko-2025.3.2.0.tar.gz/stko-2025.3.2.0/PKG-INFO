Overview
========

``stko`` is a Python library which allows for the optimisation and
property calculation of molecules constructed using the library
``stk`` https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk. There is a Discord server
for ``stk``, which can be joined through https://discord.gg/zbCUzuxe2B.


Installation
============

To get ``stko``, you can install it with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install stko

Some optional dependencies are only available through conda:

.. code-block:: bash

  # for OpenMM and espaloma charge
  # note the temporary issue with rdkit versions and conda will overwrite pip
  # installed software
  mamba install -c conda-forge pytorch==2.3.1 torchdata==0.7.1 openff-toolkit openmm openmmtools dgl rdkit==2024.3.4 espaloma_charge
  # for xtb
  mamba install xtb
  # for openbabel
  mamba install openbabel
  # for mdanalysis
  mamba install mdanalysis

Developer Setup
---------------

1. Install `just`_.
2. In a new virtual environment run:

.. code-block:: bash

  just dev

3. Run code checks:

.. code-block:: bash

  just check

.. _`just`: https://github.com/casey/just

Examples
========

We are constantly trying to add examples to the ``examples/`` directory
and maintain examples in the doc strings of ``Calculator`` and
``Optimizer`` classes.

``examples/basic_examples.py`` highlights basic optimisation with
``rdkit``, ``openbabel`` and ``xtb`` (if you have ``xtb`` available).


How To Contribute
=================

If you have any questions or find problems with the code, please submit
an issue.

If you wish to add your own code to this repository, please send us a
Pull Request. Please maintain the testing and style that is used
throughout ```stko``.
