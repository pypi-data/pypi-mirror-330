# KeyDive: Widevine L3 Extractor for Android

KeyDive is a sophisticated Python script designed for precise extraction of Widevine L3 DRM (Digital Rights Management) keys from Android devices. This tool leverages the capabilities of the Widevine CDM (Content Decryption Module) to facilitate the recovery of DRM keys, enabling a deeper understanding and analysis of the Widevine L3 DRM implementation across various Android SDK versions.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A minimum version of `frida-server 16.6.0` is required for dynamic dumps on OEM API 18+ (SDK > 33). Otherwise, extracted functions from Ghidra are required.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **ADB (Android Debug Bridge):** Make sure to install [ADB](https://github.com/hyugogirubato/KeyDive/blob/main/docs/PACKAGE.md#adb-android-debug-bridge) and include it in your system's PATH environment variable for easy command-line access.
2. **Frida-Server:** Install `frida-server` on your target Android device. This requires root access on the device. For installation instructions and downloads, visit the [official Frida documentation](https://frida.re/docs/installation/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up KeyDive:

1. Ensure all prerequisites are met (see above).
2. Install KeyDive directly from PyPI:
   ```shell
   pip install keydive
   ```

## Usage

KeyDive enables secure extraction of Widevine L3 keys in a straightforward sequence:

1. Run the KeyDive script:
   ```bash
   keydive -kwp
   ```
2. The script will install and launch the [Kaltura](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-device-info-android) DRM test app (if not already installed).
3. Follow these steps within the app:
    - **Provision Widevine** (if the device isn't provisioned).
    - **Refresh** to intercept the keybox or private key.
    - **Test DRM Playback** to extract the challenge.
4. KeyDive automatically captures the Widevine keys, saving them as:
    - `client_id.bin` (device identification data).
    - `private_key.pem` (RSA private key).

This sequence ensures that the DRM-protected content is active and ready for key extraction by the time the KeyDive script is initiated, optimizing the extraction process.

### Command-Line Options

```shell
usage: keydive [-h] [-d <id>] [-v] [-l <dir>] [--delay <delay>] [--version] [-o <dir>] [-w] [-s] [-a] [-p] [-f <file>] [-k] [--challenge <file>] [--private-key <file>]

                        Path to Ghidra XML functions file.
  -k, --keybox          Enable export of the Keybox data if it is available.
  --challenge <file>    Path to unencrypted challenge for extracting client ID.
  --private-key <file>  Path to private key for extracting client ID.

```

## Advanced Usage

### Extracting Functions

For advanced users looking to use custom functions with KeyDive, a comprehensive guide on extracting functions from Widevine libraries using Ghidra is available. Please refer to our [Functions Extraction Guide](https://github.com/hyugogirubato/KeyDive/blob/main/docs/advanced/FUNCTIONS.md) for detailed instructions.

### Offline Extraction

KeyDive supports offline extraction mode for situations without internet access. This mode allows you to extract DRM keys directly from your Android device. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed and follow the detailed [Offline Mode Guide](https://github.com/hyugogirubato/KeyDive/blob/main/docs/advanced/OFFLINE.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Obtaining Unencrypted Challenge Data

> [!NOTE]  
> Usage of unencrypted challenge is not required by default. It is only necessary when the script cannot extract the client id.

To extract the unencrypted challenge data required for KeyDive's advanced features, follow the steps outlined in our [Challenge Extraction Guide](https://github.com/hyugogirubato/KeyDive/blob/main/docs/advanced/CHALLENGE.md). This data is crucial for analyzing DRM-protected content and enhancing your DRM key extraction capabilities.

### Temporary Disabling L1 for L3 Extraction

> [!WARNING]  
> Usage of the module is now deprecated because the deactivation of the library was natively added.

Some manufacturers (e.g., Xiaomi) allow the use of L1 keyboxes even after unlocking the bootloader. In such cases, it's necessary to install a Magisk module called [liboemcrypto-disabler](https://github.com/hyugogirubato/KeyDive/blob/main/docs/PACKAGE.md#liboemcrypto-disabler)to temporarily disable L1, thereby facilitating L3 key extraction.
